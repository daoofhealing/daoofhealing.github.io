[{"content":"Original 2021-01-31\n您的关注、转发，是对我们最大的支持~\n愿我经历的苦难，你不要经历。\n纽约患者，慧45岁，在此次疫情中失去了父亲，母亲因病瘫痪，而她自己病情严重，一度高烧至39°C，血氧浓度低至80%左右，x光下肺部呈磨砂症状。几番周折办理了住院，但是因医疗资源紧缺，医院只允许她住院五天，仅提供五天的处方药（泰诺和羟铝喹）。所幸此时慧的家人通过朋友介绍结识了杨医生团队。由于情况严重，团队义工紧急派药，家人偷偷送药进医院给患者慧服用。\n一场杨医生与患者，义工与患者家人之间的紧急救援接力赛，就此展开……\n01 稀缺的医疗资源 我今年45岁，与丈夫和孩子还有父母一起住在纽约。\n2020年3月底，我感觉好像感冒了，持续低烧，怕冷，服用了感冒药。到4月初高烧39度，呼吸困难，气喘严重，味觉消失。此时我丈夫决定立即送我去医院。进院检查后得知自己的肺功能严重损坏，重要指标远低于正常值，血氧浓度只有80%左右（正常值是95%—99%），肺活量1600ml（正常是2500-3500ml）。\n看到这个情况，我想申请做核酸测试，但是由于医疗资源紧张，试剂不足，被院方拒绝，说只有严重到不能走路的情况下，医院才提供核酸测试。后来我从医护人员方面了解到疫情的严重性——大量的患者都严重到不能走路，才给配备做核酸测试的名额。\n我后来在医院拍了X光，发现肺部已经有磨砂状阴影，这是新冠肺炎的典型病理特征。由于有了这个拍片的初诊结果，医院才给我做了核酸测试，结果不出所料呈阳性。直到这时，院方才准许我办理住院手续。\n因为床位有限，医院只允许我住院五天。受物资紧缺的影响，住院期间的医疗资源也非常有限。住院时，医院给我的治疗只是用吸氧面罩吸氧和吃药，此外没有其他治疗。吃的药是泰诺和羟铝喹，医院只开了住院期间五天的药量，第一天吃两次，后面一天一次。药物短缺，出院后医院没有再给开药。\n02 四月与分离 我和丈夫，孩子，与父母住在一起，本来是个其乐融融的大家庭。\n四月，我的病情严重，住进了医院。父母症状并不明显，只是感觉有点疲劳，但是我心里还是有些担心父母，毕竟年纪大了，于是我想把父母也接到医院来治疗。\n让我没有想到的是，无常毫无征兆的降临了。80岁的父亲突然呼吸困难，家人立即拨打911送到医院救治……，谁料到隔天，父亲就永远地离开了我们！\n而我母亲几经周折，虽然最终办理了入院，但是突然情况严重，呼吸困难。在上呼吸机麻醉时出现脑血栓，从此意识不清醒，四肢瘫痪了。\n不久，妈妈从医院转入疗养院，但是因疫情隔离，不能探望。至此，从四月份的变故之后，只见上了妈妈两次，一次是送疗养院的时候，一次是十一月疗养院开放了一次探视机会。那么漫长的时间里我只见了妈妈两次。每每想到这里，我的心，伤痛不已，泪流不止！\n03 救命与药 2020年4月，是我人生里最黑暗，最艰难的日子。但也是我最幸运，最感动的日子。\n在我病重住进医院的第三天，我的家人通过朋友介绍联系到杨医生的义诊团队，派药的义工和我老公想尽办法，把杨医生开的药“仙方2号”偷偷送进医院，给我服用。\n因为疫情原因，纽约的药店都关门了，不管是中药店还是西药店。当时在外面根本买不到药。我住院五天，医生也只给我开了住院期间消炎的药，出院后没有药。所以我非常感谢杨医生，感谢义工无私的付出，感谢那些原本一群素不相识的人对我的帮助，这药太难得了！\n后来我遵照杨医生的医嘱，继续服用“仙方2号”每天三次，服用了20天后按新的医嘱改为每天服用两次，又一星期后复查时，杨医生告知我：你已经恢复，可以停药了。服药后，气喘、咳嗽、味觉消失等症状明显好转，最终完全康复，没有后遗症！同时，我的老公和孩子们服用了杨医生的预防药，一直健康，没有不适症状！\n后来的6月份我做了血清抗体检查，查出身体中已存在抗体，表明机体对新冠产生了抵抗能力。11月时，纽约核酸检测开放了，我立即做了检查，结果是阴性！\n04 值得信赖的医生 我的公公很早前就是中医，我以前在他身边跟着学中医学，知道很多药学知识，在义诊公众号看到杨医生的方子后就知道非常可行。\n杨医生在海外救了这么多人，真的可以信任，他的药很有效。杨医生已经把这么好的药都送到家门口了，义诊团队是真心真意为了挽救我们的生命。\n05 务必及时联系杨医生 我的父母因为当时情况发生得太突然，没来得及吃到杨医生的药，我真的希望他们当时能立即吃到这个药。如果你们的家人或朋友有出现新冠的症状，一定要立刻联系杨医生！希望我所经历的痛苦，你们不再经历！\n很多人没有医学常识，对杨医生的药半信半疑，在疑惑中延误了救治的宝贵时机，请大家务必相信！如果身边人出现了新冠症状，不要等，请立即联系杨晓峰医生，及时就诊！\n编者后记 最近杨医生和纽约派药义工开会，有义工反映最近有不少高龄患者才拿到药喝了一两天就进医院了，患者家属不知道该怎么办。\n此文是2020年上半年纽约的一个案例。患者刚看诊就因为血氧低住进了医院吸氧，当时杨医生说根据武汉经验，进医院吸氧的患者只有50%几率活下来，纽约派药义工和患者的先生想尽办法把药送进医院，这位患者进医院后也坚持服药，最终完全康复。\n这是特别好的一个案例，对于进医院的患者和患者家属，希望能给到你们信心！\n","description":"纽约患者，慧...在此次疫情中失去了父亲，母亲因病瘫痪，而她自己病情严重，一度高烧至39°C，血氧浓度低至80%左右，x光下肺部呈磨砂症状。几番周折办理了住院，但是因医疗资源紧缺，医院只允许她住院五天，仅提供五天的处方药...一场杨医生与患者，义工与患者家人之间的紧急救援接力赛，就此展开……","id":0,"section":"testimonials","tags":["美国"],"title":"[美国] 如果出现了新冠症状，不要等！立即联系杨医生!","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/testimonials/t-us-patient-1/"},{"content":"您的关注、转发，是对我们最大的支持~\n01 飞机高压，呼吸困难 今天怀着无比感恩的心写下这封信。\n 附：南航向杨医生表示感谢的短信 ▼ 我叫黄小兰，于2019年11月9号搭乘贵司南航CZ3359 航班从上海飞往成都。\n就在飞机起飞后不久，我父亲突发呼吸困难。家父患有严重的肺梗阻，刚刚出院。在医院医治1个多月无效后，被医生判定为无法医治，于是我们打算坐飞机返回成都。\n**可能因为飞机高空加压的问题，父亲开始呼吸困难，情况十分危急，我们不得已向求机上乘务员助于求助。**于是机上广播寻找医生，飞机同时计划返航。\n02 医术了得，父命得救 很幸运，没过多久就来了一位医生。他自我介绍姓杨，刚从加拿大返回中国，此次前往成都。\n对于这类疾病，在医院都无法医治的情况下，我们一开始并没抱多大希望，但没想到这位年轻的医生医术了得！让人惊奇的是他通过按压穴位只用了2针就让我父亲恢复自然，短短几分钟就让我父亲的呼吸顺畅了。\n图：左为杨医生\n****点击查看****\n杨医生往期义诊纪实 最美8月——川藏义诊纪实\n为了防止3个多小时的飞行期间产生意外，杨医生多次来回探视我父亲，并留针到飞机安全着陆，他救了我父亲的命。\n03 舍身助人，医德高尚 人世间没有比生命更重要的了。面对一位素不相识的病人，杨医生展现了他极高的医术与医德，并且分文不收。这让我们无比感动！\n今天写下这封信，一来感谢南航的空中帮助，二来希望南航能对这位医生给予奖励。现在事不关己愿意舍身帮助的人太少了。我们希望通过此次事件告诉大家，好人还是有的，好人一定会得到应有的奖励。\n04 各地义诊，感动感谢 另外，我听说这位杨医生经常从国外飞回祖国各地义诊，自己贴钱，捐医捐药。这次杨医生也是为了省钱，选择乘坐晚上11点多航班的经济舱，这让我非常感动！\n最后再次感谢南航的CZ3359 航班上的各位机组人员！\n黄小姐\n2019年11月16日\n编辑︱芳草\n","description":"就在飞机起飞后不久，我父亲突发呼吸困难。家父患有严重的肺梗阻，刚刚出院。在医院医治1个多月无效后，被医生判定为无法医治，于是我们打算坐飞机返回成都...但没想到这位年轻的医生医术了得！让人惊奇的是他通过按压穴位只用了2针就让我父亲恢复自然，短短几分钟就让我父亲的呼吸顺畅了...","id":1,"section":"testimonials","tags":["中国"],"title":"[中国] 万米高空 人间真爱","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/testimonials/life-saving-on-air/"},{"content":"本文大概2100字 阅读需要5分钟\n01 心有余悸 俗话说，女子本弱，为母则刚。新冠乌云已笼罩加拿大月余，一岁的稚嫩生命发烧，腹泻，哀鸣。**医生说如果病因是病毒，将无药对治。心中的负压焦灼，想必未为父母的人也心领神会。**在家人和朋友眼中，我也算是精明能干的那种，但想起宝宝这次经历，也还是会感到后怕。\n02 这可能是一种病毒 事情要从4月7号开始回放了。宝宝一周岁，我带他去儿科诊所打了疫苗。医生告诉我，过几天孩子可能会发烧。我也未在意，以前打疫苗宝宝也会短暂发烧，但不超二十四小时就好了。事出意外，半夜孩子突然发起约三十九度高烧，每四小时吃一次泰诺隆只降到约三十七度五，然后再次高烧。第二天开始拉肚子，舌苔出现舌疮，不断哭闹、不愿吃奶吃饭，只会趴在我的肩头不断地“哀鸣”（我只能这样形容孩子的声音）。\n孩子发烧第五天，我给儿科诊所打电话, 这是疫苗带来的反应吗? 医生回答说不可能，打疫苗后，孩子可能在第七至第十天发烧，但不是二十四小时之内，更不会连烧五天。这时我才开始非常紧张，问医生怎么办？他说要么你再来一次，但要再等两天。疫情期间诊所不是天天开，而且医生判断孩子是不是出了幼儿急疹？可是孩子三个月大的时候已出过幼儿急疹，发了五六天烧，烧退疹出后就好了。现在已第五天了，孩子没出过疹。\n我和先生带孩子去看医生，医生说这可能是一种病毒，出舌疮、拉肚子的症状可能都是病毒引起的。我们很紧张，到底是什么病毒？医生说他也不知道是什么病毒。我们不敢想到新冠病毒…… 三月中旬起，除了打疫苗外我们就没出去过，在家已差不多一个多月了。难道诊所有病毒吗？病毒并不是方便可测，也不是人人能测。\n03 到底要不要给孩子吃这药？ 这时我想起了杨医生。孩子病前约一两周，我特别关注这个团队，当时想做义工，但孩子太闹了，我没来得及做各种义工活动。此时我想，杨医生的药是不是能减轻一点孩子这种不明病毒引起的症状？**儿科医生说，如是病毒引起，无药对治，只能让孩子自己挺。**我很慌，已高烧5天了，每天靠吃退烧药维持，不是什么好办法。\n我又一次找到杨医生的义工团队。一个名为Grace的义工非常热心。我在义诊群发了问诊单。当天医生开出医嘱，让我们立刻开始吃治疗药，一共三天，一天两次一次一克。按流程患者须要等药，义工非常热心地让我们去取药。先生拿来药后，当时我非常犹豫到底给不给孩子吃这药，毕竟孩子才一岁，而且不知病因是不是新冠病毒。\n申请做义工时，我结识了义工团队负责人贤刚。这时我再一次联系贤刚，说出我的顾虑。**孩子这么小，他说不出哪里难受。**我只能从外观看，确实有舌疮，发高烧，而且拉肚子，腿部出现片片皮疹。医生说可能是湿疹，或不知是什么疹。我不知医生说的是否对。如果是湿疹，抹药应该好使，可是抹上药后还是不好。孩子难过，不知他是呼吸困难，是头疼，还是哪里疼？\n04 这会心再疼也得忍着 **病因也许不是新冠病毒，会不会吃错药，会不会加重病情？**贤刚安慰我说，你就放心吧，中医中药不是西药，头痛医头脚痛医脚。这药不是针对某种病的某种状态，而是提高自身免疫力。免疫力提高后，不管是什么病毒自然也被战胜了。以自己为例，他长期有鼻炎，结果吃了杨医生的药之后，鼻炎症状也减轻了很多。这药不是治鼻炎的，提高的免疫力帮助了他。我觉得贤刚说的对，既然这样，我就放心给宝宝吃一次。宝宝太小，不会主动喝药，平时喝点水都很难。我只好拿着喂辅食的针筒灌药，孩子哭得撕心裂肺。可是做母亲的都知道，这会心再疼也得忍着。\n05 迎来变化 第一次喂完药我发现孩子开始出很多汗，出汗之后，孩子很快入睡，睡得特别酣。颇为奇迹，摸额头，孩子已经一点都不烧了。之前呢，吃完退烧药，体温大概降到了三十七点六度左右，仍会反弹高烧，且不易降到三十七度以下。我看过些中医知识，发汗解表开通体内循环，能够退烧。\n不过服药后第二天，他拉肚子又频繁了。我又开始害怕担心，立刻联系贤刚。他很快帮我联系到杨医生。我问这种情况要不要继续吃剩余的两天药。**医生很肯定地说一定要坚持吃完。我一咬牙，不管怎么样吃完再说。**吃完第二天，第三天的药时，我发现孩子不发烧，舌疮减轻，腿上的疹没有了，最重要的是腹泻也减轻了。我想，也许孩子抵抗力强了，战胜病毒了吧。吃完药后，义工非常热心地问我要不要第二次反馈。我填了第二次问诊单。杨医生迅速回复说，其实拉肚子有时是好事。我想也许是排毒的过程。杨医生说最好再吃三天的预防药以巩固健康。\n吃完预防药后，孩子基本无任何症状了。至此，我觉得我的选择是非常正确的，及时吃了中药。每次吃药后孩子立刻出很多汗，出汗其实是非常好的事，它会排出体内毒素。\n不管是什么病毒——至今我也没给孩子测试到底是不是新冠病毒，只要是病毒，通过出汗拉肚子什么的，其实都可把体内毒素排出去。现在孩子再没有发出我感觉非常凄惨的哀鸣。孩子每天高高兴兴的，我做妈妈的也自然特别放心。\n06 能不能分享这个经过？ 这两天贤刚又联系我，问我能不能分享这个经过。我说非常支持这么做。我本身经历了整个过程——领药、不敢用药、最后冒险——做好最坏思想准备，承受一切后果，第一次喂药后开始特别信服，最后用完药。我希望宝宝的病例能让其他一些患者有所借鉴，让他们放心吃药。这药说白了不是药，更像提高人体免疫力的营养保健品，比药更好。是药三分毒，而它没有什么副作用。宝宝现在精力特好，开始闹了，每天音乐般的咿咿呀呀，有时候还能盖过我的声音，心中的感恩难以言表。\n愿天下人如婴儿般纯净清澈，让生命之光驱尽病疫的阴霾。\n一位母亲 | 来稿\n","description":"一岁的稚嫩生命发烧，腹泻，哀鸣。医生说如果病因是病毒，将无药对治...先生拿来药后，当时我非常犹豫到底给不给孩子吃这药，毕竟孩子才一岁...我只好拿着喂辅食的针筒灌药，孩子哭得撕心裂肺...我希望宝宝的病例能让其他一些患者有所借鉴，让他们放心吃药。这药说白了不是药，更像提高人体免疫力的营养保健品，比药更好...","id":3,"section":"testimonials","tags":["加拿大"],"title":"[加拿大] 女子本弱，为母则刚","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/testimonials/t-canada-patient-1/"},{"content":"疫情突然降临 我和爸妈、弟弟、妹妹一家五口住在意大利的威尼斯，姑妈一家三口和姑父的酒吧就在隔壁，我们两家平时常在一起吃饭聚会。自从意大利疫情开始，我和弟弟妹妹还有表弟就没去学校了，在家上中文网课，平时大人都很少出门，除非外出购物或办事。\n2月底姑父开始发烧，当时我们都以为是普通发烧没当回事，但之后一直不退烧，**姑父就去做了核酸检测，3月2号结果被确诊为新冠。**之后姑妈和表弟也去做了，结果都是阴性。\n我妈在姑夫被确诊后，好几天都感到腰很酸痛，3月5号我们一家核酸检测结果全都阳性，就立刻开始在家里隔离，日常用品和食品的采购，姑夫安排他酒吧的一位客人朋友帮我们买好后放在家门口。\n同时，我们两家都在网上填写了方舱医院的表格，之后收到了莲花清瘟胶囊和清肺汤，大家都服用了几天，服完之后又申请了，但不知什么原因迟迟没有寄到。\n进入海外义诊群 那时我姑妈打听到一家工厂曾有过二十多个人感染，全都被治好康复了，经过一位工人介绍，联系上了义工阿姨玲姐，她邀请我们进入杨医生的海外新冠义诊群。\n玲姐对进群后一系列的流程进行了指导，接着姑父和我就各自代表自己的小家庭进行具体操作，包括求诊，以及后续对整个治疗过程进行反馈。后来还有一位义工牛妈妈又把我拉进养生群学习一些辅助康复的养生方法。\n在求诊的第二天，我们就收到了第1个疗程的药。服药期间，按照医嘱需要清淡饮食，所以我妈经常给我们煮些豆类稀饭之类的主食，配素菜，要避免动物蛋白质，包括牛奶和鸡蛋。天气晴朗时，我们就会去楼下空地那里坐在凳子上晒晒太阳、和我弟弟妹妹踢踢球玩一玩。\n求诊详细记录 以下是我负责发到反馈群的我家每位成员的各疗程服用后情况，杨医生每次都及时回复下一疗程的方案：\n▲ 治疗中千万不能碰荤食\n（旋转手机查看）\n现在我和弟弟妹妹都已经完全康复了，我爸妈多干活后会有点累，体力还没完全恢复到之前很健康的状态，其它都挺好。\n我在治疗过程中有个小插曲，杨医生在看到我的第4和第5次反馈时核酸还未转阴，2次都提示我没有全素，我当时回答他一直吃素，其实有所隐瞒了，暗自意识到自己的错误就不敢再偷吃荤了。等拿到了4月13日核酸转阴的报告后，我把结果告知了杨医生，并承认了自己之前是碰了一点荤食。\n姑父一家的情况 姑父一家人的体质比我们家的好，症状没我们家人那么多，我就做个简单介绍吧：\n7岁的表弟一直是无症状，服用了1个疗程的1号方后就保持观察，一直都挺好。\n43岁的姑妈求诊时有点咳嗽，之后出现喉咙疼和头疼，在服用4个疗程的2号方期间逐步好转；最后服了第5个疗程的1号方后，巩固恢复得很好。\n50岁的姑父一开始的症状是忽冷忽热和咳嗽，在服用了第1个疗程2号方后咳嗽症状就减轻了；之后出现尿急尿频、嘴苦、失眠的症状，再服了4个疗程2号方就都改善了，4月8号转阴；最后第6个疗程1号方之后，睡眠还不是很好，其它都恢复正常。目前他的睡眠都挺好的了。\n给杨医生和义工阿姨们点赞 最后我想对杨医生和义工阿姨们说，在我眼里，你们都是很有爱心的长辈！因为你们，我们两家人才能得以康复，谢谢你们！\n2021年5月\n约稿：芳\n写稿：芳\n校对：取\n排版：不二\n审核：Monica\n","description":"我和爸妈、弟弟、妹妹一家五口住在意大利的威尼斯...3月5号我们一家核酸检测结果全都阳性...在求诊的第二天，我们就收到了第1个疗程的药。服药期间，按照医嘱需要清淡饮食...我想对杨医生和义工阿姨们说，在我眼里，你们都是很有爱心的长辈！因为你们，我们两家人才能得以康复，谢谢你们！","id":4,"section":"testimonials","tags":["意大利"],"title":"[意大利] 一家五口全部感染，威尼斯14岁少女为全家记录新冠治疗过程","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/testimonials/t-italy-patient-1/"},{"content":"Herbal Supplement Qualifications   All those free herbal supplements are nutrients extracted from natural plants using high-tech, regulating the human body\u0026rsquo;s internal environment, and improving its immune function.\n  The pharmaceutical factory of supplements has obtained GMP certification, international ISP9001/2000 certification, ISO17025 TAF international laboratory certification, ILAC-MRA certification, IA certification, APLAC certification.

Considering that most of these people are stranded abroad due to the changes in China’s entry policies, adjusted flights, and financial difficulties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, many enterprises and communities are actively participating in disaster relief.\nBy June 21, 2020, over 8.7 million coronavirus cases and 460 thousand deaths had been reported across the globe. With the help of volunteers, by June 13, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had provided free medical services for 720 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations provided reaching 1504, whereas, by June 21, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had helped 989 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in North America, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations hitting 2152. Dr. Yang’s dispensation of over 240 thousand concentrated powered of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had seen zero deaths among those patients. The youngest patient is only one month old, while the oldest is 82 years old – their recoveries were confirmed by negative COVID-19 test results. Many infected Chinese people abroad as well as non-Chinese received by Dr. Yang and his team are recovering consecutively. None of them were seen to have serious post-COVID long-term syndrome. Nor did previous coronavirus patients in Wu Han, China, also received by Dr. Yang nearly three months ago, report any reinfection cases. But for the help of over 100 volunteers in Dr. Yang’s team, these would be unachievable.\nPerhaps the bereaved families who lost their loved ones suffer much more than death once the coronavirus has long-term impacts on these people, thought Dr. Yang. Since the Ministry of Health in different countries agreed that COVID vaccines are expected as soon as early next year, then what can we do since the vaccines are still half a year away?\nActually, the Eastern Han Dynasty had experienced over 300 pandemics. What did our ancestors do, and what will they do confronting the worldwide pandemics today? It is noteworthy that our ancestors had accumulated rich experiences to fight the pandemics and conquered numerous pandemics by self-quarantining, locking down and tossing limestone powder, etc. With those cases in Wu Han, China again demonstrated to the world the value of TCM, containing within it five thousand years of Chinese wisdom and culture. Not only did it rescue people from hanging upside down, but it also promoted economic recovery in Wu Han and in China. Certainly, China has more cultural values - as priceless as antique collections - to show people all over the world just when they need it most and just when they suffer most. With the development of science and technology, human beings are able to discover state-of-the-art vaccines. However, what are vaccines? Vaccines refer to bio-products derived from different pathogenic microorganisms to prevent and control all kinds of pandemics. They can be divided into live (attenuated) virus vaccines and killed (inactivated) vaccines. Common live virus vaccines include Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Measles, and plague vaccine, etc., while common killed vaccines include Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus, typhoid fever, Meningococcus, and Cholera Vaccine, etc. It usually takes one to two years to develop a new type of vaccine, by weakening or inactivating the pathogenic microorganism, or providing the genetic code for part of the pathogenic microorganism to prevent and control the pandemics. During the primary immune response to the first encounter with the unharmful pathogen, the immune system produces protective substances such as immunization hormones, active physiological substances, special antigens, etc., to protect the body. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. To put it more simply, vaccination is to use weakened, the unharmed virus that does not cause serious disease in people to enable the immunization to recognize and fight against the virus, so that the immune system will react to and fight infections automatically in the future. That’s why live, attenuated vaccines might cause fever and some other symptoms in weakened immunization systems. It is a war, an inflammatory storm between the immunization system and the virus.\nNow we understand that it is our own immunization systems that fight against those invading enemies. In other words, a vaccine cannot work without our immunity. Vaccinations are used to “train,” and “educate” the immune system in order to ultimately fight the infections. This teaches us that as long as our immunization cells are “well-learned,” our bodies produce antibodies to react to the viruses whenever they attack us again.\nHence, can we say that TCM may also function as a form of “vaccine”?\nThe way doctors of TCM think is a composition of Taiji Yin-Yang philosophy in Taoism and form-and-emptiness philosophy in Buddhism. For example, when one is asked “Where is the east,” the answer is, “There, the west is, where are the heart and spirit? There is seven Level of Quest for heart and spirit – no facet of life remains outside your spiritual growth and vision.”\nIn fact, the profundity of TCM lies in its preservation of one’s state of being/health, rather than the treatment of the disease, for it is already too late when the disease invades the body. People with strong immunity, as mentioned in the previous article on the Wechat media platform, recover soon with the help of TCM. However, the problem today is that people are ignorant of staying healthy and clutch at a straw the moment they are drowning - seriously ill. One of the coronavirus patients in the United States posted his medical bills – the amount is up to over 110 million dollars. He might be unable to pay off the debts even by using up his saving for a lifetime. Comparatively speaking, preservation of one’s being/health is much cheaper. The most important part of the preservation of one’s being/heart lies in the preservation of one’s heart and spirit, which is not only cheap but also effective.\nDr. Yang and his team referenced multiple ancient books of TCM. One day, at dawn, it suddenly occurred to Dr. Yang that the virus can be mitigated and killed by strengthening people’s immunity, and thus the TCM then used to strengthen people’s immunity will be called the TCM vaccine. Now our primary concern is to find the Chinese herbal prescription to strengthen people’s immune function. After rounds of discussions, analyses, and research, Dr. Yang and his team chose a classic prescription from ancient China. It is this TCM vaccine that saved accompanying family members in Wu Han, and medical workers in Wu Han, New York, Montréal, and Britain from being infected. Some Western medical workers start to get curious about the TCM vaccine; their trial of it saved them from infections. One medical worker, whose health condition is but of average level, was seen to have fully recovered within two weeks after taking the TCM prescription. Facts speak louder than words. A myriad of examples has proved the reliability of this TCM prescription.\nIn the middle of the following March 2020, we applied our approach and theory to the overseas market and provided TCM prescriptions to patients, their families, and medical workers. The surge in COVID-19 cases overseas witnessed many new symptoms that are different than those in Wu Han. The first time the COVID-19 overseas were found to get more severe and start to attack people’s central nervous systems, our team felt more anxious than ever, waiting for the feedback. Time flies. One month later, the clinical experience from the frontier and has brought positive feedback: among those medical workers who use our No 1. prescription, nobody was reported to have infected the virus. The test results showed that many people already had antibodies in their blood, proving the validity of the TCM vaccine.\nThis discovery overthrows the previous Western-dominated medical theories and illustrates with successful clinical experiences not only the new Chinese perspective but also the power of TCM. In addition, the secret about TCM lies in its dosage: people with different body constitutions and different symptoms should take different dosages at different times. The ultimate purpose, though, is to strengthen the immunity of the body.\nDr. Yang\n2020-06-22\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"posts","tags":[],"title":"Preventive Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/posts/tcm-vaccine/"},{"content":"Preface\nThis is a patient with advanced lung cancer who turned to Dr. Yang for help in April. The cancer had spread all over the body and metastasized to the bones. After Dr. Yang treating her for more than a month, she went for a PET/CT again. We can see that 70% of the cancer cells that had metastasized to the bones disappeared, and even the doctor examining the PET/CT image was amazed and asking how this good result was achieved.\nPatient\u0026rsquo;s family provided: patient\u0026rsquo;s PET/CT image diagnosis report In April of this year, my mother suddenly felt pain in her shoulder and back, and my family thought it was frozen shoulder. So she took some physical therapy visits. But after a few days, the pain came back, and it worsened, affecting her body movement. After a CT scan, the doctor told me that my mother had pathological fractures and the doctor suspected my mother got lung cancer, and that bone metastases had occurred. On hearing this news we were extremely shocked.\nProvided by the patient’s family: patient hospital-transfer approval I immediately arranged my mom to be transferred to the best hospital in town - the Affiliated Hospital to Southwest Medical University, where she had further tests in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, such as CT, chest puncture, genetic testing, etc. The final diagnosis was advanced lung cancer and bone metastases had occurred. My family and I were devastated.\nMy mother had no symptoms at all previous to her diagnosis and she was very healthy. She could walk 10 kilometers nonstop. How could she suddenly suffer from a terminal disease, and diagnosed as at the advanced stage? I was so shocked at the day of the bad news that I was unable to sleep for five days in a row and lost 8 pounds. I am 40 years old and have never been unable to sleep. This news hit me extremely hard.\nAt this time, I told my best friend, Mr. Cai, who recommended Dr. Yang to us while comforting us. I met Dr. Yang in 2015 once and he helped me to improve my health. Dr. Yang immediately contacted me via WeChat, and after understanding my situation, asked me two questions, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to save your mom? Are you willing to trust me?\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to accept him and trust him. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing good deeds and accumulating good merit, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rescuing stray cats and dogs, rescuing left-behind children, and raising money for good cause, etc. I think this is due to my accumulated good merit.\nDr. Yang immediately told me about the regimen and precautions.\nStep 1: Let mom fast.\nStep 2: Dr. Yang taught me how to do moxibustion and told me to start doing it right away (I happened to have Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s homemade moxibustion strips which I bought earlier).\nAt first, I was confused about the fasting program, thinking, \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we give her more nutrition? How come she wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to eat? But I was determined to trust Dr. Yang. We followed the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions to the letter. Strangely enough, on the third day of fasting, which was also the third day after the moxibustion, my mom was not in pain anymore. The body pain turned into soreness and swelling, and we became more confident and more determined to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s treatment plan.\n(Translation of the image above: This is an advanced lung cancer patient accepted by Dr. Yang in April. As shown in the photo, the cancer has spread to the whole body, even to the bones. Many doctors had said that it was incurable. The patient came to Dr. Yang for help. Dr. Yang treated her for more than a month. When she did a body scan again we can see that 70% of the cancer cells metastasized to the bone had disappeared. Even the examination doctor asked what they did to achieve this. I asked Dr. Yang many times and he told me that one of the important points was to use Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. I know about Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. He wanted to make moxa sticks himself in the early 2000s. However, for the past 18 years, the cause and conditions were not sufficient to make them. Dr. Yang traveled all over China and bought almost all the moxa sticks he could buy. In order to make good moxa, he went to the rural countryside, and stayed in the hand-made moxa production workshop, eating and sleeping on site*. The current situation of domestic moxa production is very complicated. The genuine* three-year-long moxa is very rare; in so many years I have only seen one genuine five-year moxa seller, and honestly speaking, I have no five-year moxa myself. Currently, almost all so-called “wild moxa” are replaced by farm-produced moxa in the moxa market. In terms of the production process, the machine-made golden moxa replaced the original hand-made moxa. 100kg of Chinese mugwort can only produce 35kg of moxa if hand-made, whereas 90kg of moxa can be generated if made by machines. In order to look good, the machine-made moxa are all baked in high temperature to get the golden color. However, in this process, 30% of the moxa’s medicinal effect is lost and the moxa will produce a lot of smoke during moxibustion. As machine-made moxa come from Chinese mugwort which are not grown old enough, these moxa are quite humid. Moreover, one-year grown Chinese mugwort is even somewhat toxic. Dr. Yang always believes that only good medicine can cure illness so he never saves on the medicine cost. The moxa made this time are not planned to make commercial profits, so there is no saving on the production cost of the moxa. The moxa Dr. Yang made received good reviews from a small group of users and are exported to countries such as France, Canada, the U.S., and Spain. )\nDr. Yang taught us the location of the specific acupoints and the ordering of which acupoint to do moxibustion first. Every day my father and I took turns to do it for my mother. At first, in order to help dredge my mother’s meridians as soon as possible, every day we did moxibustion for every acupoint for more than half an hour. As for the important acupoints, we did moxibustion for more than an hour on each of them. Every day we did two rounds of moxibustion ( finishing all the acupoints in the right order was regarded as one round ), which took us basically 9 hours a day to complete.\nI got up after 5 am to make breakfast for my mother the way Dr. Yang told me. Then I did the standing stumps practice (Zhan Zhuang) and sitting meditation with her together. After that I went out for exercise and walking. After coming home and taking a short rest, I started the daily moxibustion treatment for my mother. I gave my mother fresh fruit and vegetable juice as supplements during the process. At noon, I gave my mother coarse grains and fresh vegetables for lunch, and I strictly avoided all meat in her diet. In the afternoon, I gave her a little bit of tremella lily soup. There was no dinner, and no food after 7 pm for my mother. In the first three days she was not adapted to it and felt hungry at night. Later she got used to it.\nLater, I received the herbal medicine prepared by Dr. Yang. My mother had nausea and vomited in the first two days of taking the medicine, but the symptoms stopped since the third day. After taking the medicine for a week, I sent a photo of my mother’s tongue to Dr. Yang for examination, and the appearance of her tongue indicated improvement. Dr. Yang told me: “Keep everything the same. Other than that, she could eat some fresh vegetables at night, just a little bit.” After another week, my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue appearance indicated huge improvement again. Then Dr. Yang asked us to change to another type of moxibustion. He changed the acupoints and adjusted the herbal medicine in our treatment plan.\nMy mother used to feel tired right away whenever she started any physical exercise after being diagnosed with cancer, like a cell phone which can only function for 5 minutes after charging 2 hours. Now she shows great improvement. We clearly feel that she has more energy - her voice is getting louder, and her spirit is getting better. Our whole family feels a little relieved. Day after day, on the 21st day, there was an incident. Dr. Yang suddenly noticed that the photo of my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue showed regression in health conditions. He immediately talked to me on the phone to check the recent situation and then asked me to stop the targeted drugs, as my mother had been taking the targeted drugs prescribed by the hospital at the same time, which were quite harmful to the liver. The harm done was reflected in my mother’s tongue photo and Dr. Yang noticed this astutely in time. After discussing with my family, I decided to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s advice and let my mother stop the targeted drugs, which was a bold decision based on my strong trust in Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical ethics and skills.\nA mother’s son\n2021.06\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"difficultcases","tags":["Cancer Treatment"],"title":"Real story｜Mom's anti-cancer diary (Part one)","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/difficultcases/mom-cancer-diary-1/"}]
