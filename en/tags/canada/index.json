[{"content":"Posture and Key Points First of all, the principles of Zhan-Zhuang (standing meditation, sometimes called standing stumps practice) and meditation are actually the same. It\u0026rsquo;s just us labeling them as different things.\nIn terms of appearance, one is practiced in a standing form and the other is practiced in a sitting form. Nowadays, many of us spend more time sitting and less time standing, so today I will probably talk more about ‚Äúsitting‚Äù and less about ‚Äústanding‚Äù.\nWe all know somewhat the key points of the correct Zhan-Zhuang posture. One of them is that the acupoint on this side (at the right shoulder), and this point (at the left shoulder), should be aligned to our groin. And the two feet should be parallel, whereas the space in between them should not be too narrow, nor too wide. These six points should be in a straight line, as this is related to our body\u0026rsquo;s meridians.\nüëÜThe position pointed out in the picture is the acupoint on Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s right shoulder\nThis is the posture of Zhan-Zhuang. Then the main principle of Zhan-Zhuang is that the whole body must be relaxed. Let\u0026rsquo;s start from the top of the body. You can open your eyes, or slightly close your eyes. This is actually the same as sitting meditation. Then we put our lower jaw gently downward. We have two carotid arteries on both sides of the neck. The carotid artery has a lot of pressure within. You can see how high the blood can spray out when the general or soldier commit suicide by cutting their neck in movies and television dramas.\nIt is usually about one or two meters! This is tested in modern medicine. So, the blood pressure is very very high. In fact, these four vessels - our carotid arteries and the two (at the back of the neck) vertebral arteries - they contain very high pressure. Thus we need to put our jaw down and press it down a little to avoid the blood going upward too fast.\nIt is the same as sitting meditation. The waist cannot be too straight. If you stand with a very straight waist, the qi will rush upward and we will feel very hot. Therefore, the waist should be in a relaxed state, not too straight, and not to bend waist. It\u0026rsquo;s the same with Zhan-Zhuang and sitting meditation - the waist should be relaxed.\nAlso same as in sitting meditation, our abdomen should be tucked in a little bit. Do not sit too straight. If we tuck our belly in a little, we will find ourselves very relaxed. But if we are too straight, we will feel too hot. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to be in a relaxed state.\nBoth in sitting meditation and Zhan-Zhuang, our abdominal chakra is a very important place. Chinese medicine calls this area Shenque acupoint and Guanyuan acupoint; in Taoism it is called the lower Dantian.\nThis place should be in a relaxed state so that the energy is easy to gather. If you are too tense, too tight, too straight, the energy won\u0026rsquo;t easily gather in this area, and we will have no way to form the Neidan ( in Taoism energy is gathered in lower Dantian to form the Neidan). This is a key point.\nWhere to Put the Tongue Therefore, an essential point of practicing Zhan-Zhuang is to get our bodies in a state of complete relaxation. We have already talked about head position. Now we are going to talk about where we should put our tongues. We need to put the tongue on the palate. But here comes a tricky question: should you put your tongue at the front, middle or back part of your palate? I know lots of people putting their tongue at the front part of their palate. The positioning is actually incorrect. Pressing here (middle part of the palate) will be much better than here (front part of the palate), but it is best to press here (back part of the palate).\nPressing this place (middle part of the palate) helps towards opening the ‚Äúfan xue‚Äù, which is therefore not highly recommended. The reason is that nowadays many people are not in a calm state of mind and thus pressing our tongue at the middle part of the palate can possibly lead to disastrous symptoms mentally and/or physically.\nI recommend first using a posture coming from Taoism\u0026rsquo;s practice of ‚Äúbuilding the foundation in a hundred day‚Äù: Curl our tongue and press the tip of our tongue on the back of the palate. When we do that saliva will come out slowly and after we swallow it, it will return to our root chakra.\nWe swallow the saliva back in a slow pace because the saliva contains the essence of life. This is why old people produce less saliva. The younger and healthier a person is, the more saliva the person generates, as it is the essence of life.`\nSo gently press your tongue against here (back part of the palate). Do this naturally and in a relaxed way. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Thus far we have talked about head, eye, jaw, and tongue positions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t stretch your head too far frontward and do not let it stiffen up. Keep it naturally relaxed. The benefit is when you relax your head your shoulders will be relaxed accordingly. Many people do not relax their heads which leads to their whole bodies tightening up.\nKeeping Our Muscles Relaxed From my observation, a lot of people are very tense when they are practicing Zhan-Zhuang or meditation. That\u0026rsquo;s why you will often get a ‚Äúwarning stick ‚Äú strike (warning stick, also called as ‚Äúkeisaku‚Äù, is a tool used in Zen Buddhism for various purposes such as helping concentration during meditation). You see, you shouldn‚Äôt be too loose both mentally and physically, and you shouldn‚Äôt be too tight either. When someone strikes a warning stick on you, you feel all of a sudden relaxed and loose, right?\nBecause some people, in fact, most people, 99% of people are very nervous in daily life. So that‚Äôs why walking, living, sitting and sleeping are all practices towards enlightenment. He/she has to be in a very relaxed state in daily life, and after a very relaxed state, the circulations of qi and blood will be very smooth.\nWhen our muscles are tense, we know how anaerobic feels. ‚ÄúAnaerobic‚Äù means bad blood circulation, right? So when we are relaxed we are in an aerobic state. The qi and blood can circulate in this state. So through slow walking, jogging, we are in a very relaxed state and hence qi and blood are easy to circulate.\nWhen we are in an anaerobic state, we are very nervous. Most of us walk, live, sit and sleep in an anaerobic state throughout the day. When the body is in an anaerobic state, it will burst huge power for a short period of time, and this short period of explosive power encourages cell mutation. The cancer cells usually appear in an anaerobic state.\nWhy nowadays there are many people getting tumors and cancer? Mostly because they are in an anaerobic state and they are not relaxed physically and mentally. In fact, the feeling of resentment, hatred, annoyance, grievance, and upset are all part of his/her uneasiness. If his/her viscera are in a very relaxed state, he/she will not get any health issues. So the majority of liver cancer, stomach cancer, kidney cancer, and intestinal cancer cases are due to blockage, meaning that the blood is not circulating in that area.\nWhy nowadays there are many people getting tumors and cancer? Mostly because they are in an anaerobic state and they are not relaxed physically and mentally. In fact, the feeling of resentment, hatred, annoyance, grievance, and upset are all part of his/her uneasiness. If his/her viscera are in a very relaxed state, he/she will not get any health issues. So the majority of liver cancer, stomach cancer, kidney cancer, and intestinal cancer cases are due to blockage, meaning that the blood is not circulating in that area.\nTherefore that area is prone to generate certain bad body tissues. Especially the state of depression and stagnation of the cells will lead to a lot of cell‚Äôs death. The very few stronger cells, in order to survive, mutate and become cancer cells. That\u0026rsquo;s where the cancer cells come from.\nArouse the Immune System This is a relaxed state that we just mentioned. So why do we say that the upper body should be in a state of our chest slightly drawn in and our back straight? This (shoulder) place looks very nice when chest is kept very straight. However, because this place is too straight, this place is tense and not relaxed. So we need to relax this place.\nOur body has three immune systems. The first one is the neck lymph. We call it the neck lymphatic system. The second one is the underarm lymphatic system, and the third is the inguinal lymphatic system.\nüëÜThe position pointed out in the picture is the acupoints on shoulder to be relaxed\nThere are two important acupoints here in the shoulder area, both are slightly sunken in. As this place is very close to the first immune system of our human body, when we relax our shoulders, the neck lymph system and the underarm lymph system are relaxed as well. When we relax our shoulders continuously, these two immune systems will be aroused and they will become strong.\nWhen we are constantly in a state of tension, our immune system would be consequentially in a high-pressure state, and thus its functions become poor. So when we relax our body, it will be relatively strong.\nOur body has two nervous systems: one is the central nervous system and the other is the self-disciplined nervous system. The central nervous system controls our viscera from our brain, but some organs of our body have a self-disciplined nervous system themselves, and it is called the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in clinical medicine.\nThus, for example, our liver has a sympathetic nerve and a parasympathetic nerve. When we are nervous, our sympathetic nerve starts to function. It starts to work and mobilize resources.\nFor another example, when we are very nervous, the mechanism of the secretion of adrenal hormone, which belongs to a disciplined nerve of the kidney, begins to work. So it is a good thing for the adrenal hormone to start mobilizing, but after a long time, it gets tense and becomes tired.\nSo when we start to relax, our internal organs and parasympathetic nerves start to function, which can repair some damage in our body.\nSo, when we practice Zhan-Zhuang or meditation and go into a relaxed state, the parasympathetic nerves of our viscera begin to work. It begins to repair our body. This is why we need to relax when practicing Zhang Zhuang or meditation. Relaxation is playing a role in repairing the state of the body function.\nMost of us are in a state of tension and not relaxed enough, as most of us are very persistent and deeply attached to all sorts of things. Therefore we are relatively nervous no matter what we do, sometimes even unconsciously. So, our body is always in a state of tiredness and fatigue.\nIf we are not deeply attached to doing anything as well as its outcome, we will do what we need to do but rather in a very relaxed way. Our body would not have a state of fatigue and tiredness.\nWhat I said above is about a state of our body. Now let us talk about our back. Our back has many T cells, which are also our immune cells.\nWe said previously that our back posture should be straight with our chest slightly drawn in. But if we stretch our back very tight, it would be very tense. When we are very relaxed, the immune cells of our bodies also will be naturally in a relaxed state, thus facilitating their own recovery one by one.\nMoreover, drawing in our chest and keeping our back straight naturally at the same time smooths the qi in our lungs. And if we stretch our lung very tight, as the lung connects to all meridians in our bodies, the breath of the lung is not so smooth. So, when our back is straight naturally and our chest slightly drawn in, when we are relaxed like this, the qi in our lungs is easier to flow, and we will feel more comfortable.\nThe Key Points of the Lower Body Posture In the above, we talked about the upper body. As for the lower body, the most important key point is about the waist and the abdomen. As for the abdomen, the abdomen needs to be drawn in, and by doing this our waist will bend backward automatically, right? When our waist is very tight and straight, the hot qi moves upwards, and our abdomen will be very tense. This is not good for our energy to concentrate at our lower Dantian. So we want the abdomen to draw in, and we want our abdomen and waist to sink and not to stand too straight. This is a problem with the lower body posture.\nThen let‚Äôs talk about our feet. When practicing Zhan-Zhuang, our feet should not be standing straight. I have already mentioned the length between the feet - our feet should be aligned to our shoulder and our groin.\nThe inguinal lymphatic system in the groin area is the third lymphatic system of our human body. A lot of terminal cancer patients when doing B-ultrasound scanning, are found cancer cells spread to the neck lymphatic system.\nPatients in severe health conditions will get cancer cells spread to the underarm lymphatic system. When a patient gets CT scanning and found the inguinal lymphatic system is getting infected, then this patient is basically incurable. All the immune cells of this patient got infected and defeated. This is as if all of one‚Äôs royal guards are eliminated, then what does this person have to protect his/her viscera and body?\nSo I know that a patient is in the worst phase of terminal cancer if that person has the inguinal lymphatic system infected. It is very hard to cure at this stage.\nNot all diseases can be cured. When a person is terminally ill, when he/she is already dying, it is really difficult for him/her to be saved. Of course, there is a way, but we will talk about this later, and we will not mention this topic here.\nSo the width between the standing legs is the same as the width of our two shoulders, not too wide or too narrow. Also, the legs should be slightly curved when standing.\nThe goal of all these postures is to help us relax. As when our body and mind are not separated yet, the body is quite important.\nBut in the end of our practice, we can separate the body and mind naturally. Now that we haven‚Äôt reached this state, our consciousness cannot go out yet, and it hasn‚Äôt reached the state of immortality mentioned in Taoism. Our body and the mind, are combined together, and they are not completely separated.\nSo we must first maintain relaxation to the level that the qi and blood can circulate and flow smoothly. This point is actually very, very important. So one of the main points of our Zhan-Zhuang and meditation is to relax, relax and relax.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"excercise","tags":["Meditation","Standing Meditation"],"title":"Zhan-Zhuang and Meditation - The Detailed Tutorial","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/excercise/meditation-detailed-guide/"},{"content":"Subvert your ideas!

The one-year-old child had a lasting fever, diarrhea, and was wailing. The pediatrician said that if the virus caused it, there was no medicine to treat it; the child could only pull through it. Even non-parents would understand the mother\u0026rsquo;s anxiety and worries at this time.\nAlthough considered shrewd and capable in her family\u0026rsquo;s and friends\u0026rsquo; eyes, Alice still feels scared when she recalls this experience.\n02 It might be a virus Playing back the experience from April 7, our baby turned one year old, I took him to a pediatric clinic for a vaccine. The doctor told me that the child might have a fever in a few days. I didn\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. The baby had been vaccinated before, and after a short-term fever, he was fine within 24 hours. Unexpectedly, on the sixth day, the baby suddenly developed a fever of about 39¬∞C.He was given Tylenol every four hours, but his body temperature only dropped to about 37.5¬∞C, before a high fever rose again. The next day diarrhea started; tongue sores appeared; he was unwilling to drink milk or anything else. He was just lying on my shoulders and continuously \u0026ldquo;wailing\u0026rdquo; (I can only describe the child\u0026rsquo;s voice like this).\nI called the doctor. ‚ÄúIs this a response from the vaccine?‚Äù I asked. The doctor answered it was impossible. A baby may have a fever from the seventh to the tenth day after vaccination, but the fever will go away within 24 hours and not last five consecutive days. I became very nervous and asked the doctor what to do. The doctor supposed it was an acute baby rash. When the baby was three months old, he had a baby rash combined with a fever lasting five or six days. Now in the fifth day, no rash had appeared. The doctor said that I could come again, but I had to wait two days. During the pandemic, the practice was not open every day.\nMy husband and I took the child to see a doctor. The doctor said it might be a virus, and the virus may cause symptoms of tongue sores and diarrhea. We were very nervous. What virus was it? The doctor said he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the virus was; if the virus caused it, there was no cure for it, and the child could only fight it off by himself. We didn\u0026rsquo;t dare to think about COVID-19. Since mid-March, we had not been out except for the baby‚Äôs vaccination. We had been at home for almost a month. Was there a virus in the clinic? At that time, COVID-19 was not easily detectable, nor could every one test accurately in perceived suspected cases.\nI fell into a panic. The baby had a high fever for five days, and he could not take anti-fever medication every day.\n03 After all that, should I give the medicine to my baby? Then I thought of Dr. Yang. About a week or two before my baby got sick, I paid particular attention to his team and even planned to volunteer, but the baby was so fussy that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time. At this point, I thought perhaps Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine might relieve the symptoms caused by the unknown virus?\nOnce again, I contacted Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s volunteer team. With their warm-hearted help, I filled out a form for the first online consultation. Dr. Yang advised on the same day: treatment started immediately with 1g herbal mixture twice daily for three days. Following the consultation process, patients have to wait for their medication to be delivered, but the volunteers organized a pick-up. After my husband brought the medicine home, I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby. After all, the baby was only one year old, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if the cause was COVID-19.\n04 Enduring the distress AgainÔºå I contacted Xiangang, the leader of the volunteer team, to express my concerns. **What if this was the wrong medication and aggravated the illness? **Xianggang reassured me, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; Chinese medicine treats the symptoms and gets to the root of the problem. The herbal mixture is not aimed at a state of a disease but rather at improving immunity. No matter what the virus is, a strengthened immune system will fight it off naturally.\u0026quot;\nTaking himself as an example,he said he had had rhinitis for a long time. After taking Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine, the rhinitis symptoms reduced significantly. This medicine is not for rhinitis, but the improved immunity helped him. I thought Xiangang was right, and I felt assured enough to give this medicine to the baby once. The baby was too young to take the medication actively. It was even challenging to get him to drink some water. I had to give him the preparation by mouth with a syringe.\n05 The change The first time I gave the medicine, I noticed the baby began to sweat a lot. After that, the baby fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. Touching his forehead, the baby had no fever anymore. In the past, after taking an antipyretic, his temperature dropped to about 37.6¬∞Cand rebounded with a high fever later, but the temperature rarely fell below 37¬∞C. I‚Äôve read some information about Traditional Chinese Medicine, inducing sweat and relieving superficies stimulates inner circulation and reduces fever.\nThe day after the baby took the medicine, he had diarrhea again. I became afraid and contacted Xiangang immediately. He quickly put me in touch with Dr. Yang. I asked if the baby should continue to take medicine for the remaining two days. The doctor said with confidence that we must stick to it. I must dig my toes in to finish giving him the medication for three days. By the end of the third day, the child had no fever, the sores on his tongue resolved, the rashes on his legs cleared up, and most importantly, diarrhea was relieved. I think perhaps the child\u0026rsquo;s strengthened immunity had overcome the virus.\nIn the second consultation, Dr. Yang said that diarrhea is sometimes a good thing (I think it\u0026rsquo;s a detoxification process.) Doctor Yang says it\u0026rsquo;s best to take preventive medication for three more days to establish health. After taking the preventive medication, the child no longer had any symptoms. So far, I felt that I had made the right choice.\n06 Can you share this experience? Two days ago, Xiangang contacted me again and asked if I could share this experience. I said I strongly supported it. I hope that some other patients will benefit from our baby\u0026rsquo;s case. This medicine is more like a nutritional supplement that improves immunity. The baby is very energetic now, babbling like music every day, and sometimes his voice can overwhelm my voice. The gratitude in my heart is beyond words.\nI wish people in the world would be as pure and clear as babies and let the light of life drive away the pandemic\u0026rsquo;s haze.\nA mother‚Äôs contribution\n","description":"I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby.

Not only does it affect the global economy and change everyone\u0026rsquo;s life and workstyle, but it also affects our physical and mental health. After nearly two years of a silent war against the epidemic and the promotion of vaccination, the epidemic seems to be at a turning point.\nEveryone seems to have been adapted to and accepted the new way of getting along with the epidemic, and no longer \u0026ldquo;fear the epidemic\u0026rdquo;; or we think that after we get vaccinated, we will have antibodies to protect us from the virus. However, who could have predicted that a special \u0026ldquo;product of the epidemic era\u0026rdquo; would quietly arise and lurk in our bodies?\nIt is the \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - the \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;. This type of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; is a side effect of the coronavirus vaccine, similar to allergies, eczema, rubella, measles, hives, chicken pox or shingles. For the time being, there seems to be no accurate answer, and it is up to the medical professionals to investigate.\nHere I would like to share my experience of fighting the rash. It‚Äôs just for your reference**. Some of my friends also experienced the rash after the vaccination, but the timing and symptoms of the rash varied from person to person. So was the treatment and recovery period.** It took me about 3 months after the vaccination to get this \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo;.\nA Friendly Reminder\nIf you have this kind of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; symptom, please seek medical attention immediately. Follow the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions and cooperate with the treatment for early recovery. Remember there is an old saying: \u0026ldquo;A disease should be treated when symptoms are still very light, and let a disease untreated is like watching a tiger growing up.‚Äù\nSeek prompt medical attention for \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo; On September 27, 2021, which was a Monday afternoon, I felt a little bit itchy on my back and didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to it. After midnight, I felt that my whole spine and shoulders were hot, and my back was covered with a thick red rash. The itch was unbearable and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep, but fortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fever.\nIn the morning of September 28, I immediately contacted Dr. Yang and received medical treatment from him. Within 4 days, I was almost fully recovered and the rash was all gone.\nPhysical, mental and dietary adjustments I think when dealing with any illness, the first and foremost thing to do is to calm your mind. As mental health directly affects physical health, it is important to keep a positive mindset when being sick. Secondly, it is important to adjust the body through diet and exercise, so that a strong and healthy body can resist the disease.\nAdjust your diet according to Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical advice  Eat light. Do not eat seafood, shrimp, crab, and eat less meat. (Remark: I am a vegetarian.) Do not eat cold and raw food: apples, bananas, pears, and oranges. Above food must be stewed and served hot. Eat some medically mild food: tomatoes, fungus, dark green vegetables/cauliflower; drink warm water/soup, and take ginger soup when needed. Do not eat spicy and greasy food. Drink as much warm water as possible after moxibustion.  Physical exercises generate Yang of one‚Äôs body During the treatment of \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;, I was severely sleep-deprived, and I felt very tired and wanted to sleep during the day. However, I continued to do appropriate indoor exercises in the morning and in the evening. Such as BaDuanJin Qigong, shaking hands at least 200 times, vertical jumping 70-100 times, squatting and standing up at least 50 times, etc. I tried not to do outdoor activities and avoid the wind.\nEvery time after these exercises, my whole body felt warm and hot. This is the so-called \u0026ldquo;movement can produce Yang\u0026rdquo;. I think these exercises can improve our blood circulation and inject some natural heat energy into the body. With the proper heat, it boosts our metabolism and helps our body to recover.\nCommonalities and differences in rashes Commonality: Sleepless \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash is active during the second half of the night, and is particularly itchy and disruptive to sleep.\nDifferences: Wandering \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash wanders and stays in various parts of the body with different symptoms.\nMy 4-day anti-rash record Day 1\nTuesday, September 1\nNeck rash ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on arms ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on the outside of legs‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on the inner side of legs ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nSymptoms: Red, itchy, and hot rashes appear around the neck, on the back, and on both sides of arms and legs.\nDon‚Äôt: wash with cold water or scratch with fingers.\nMoxibustion alternatively: Mingmen, Dazhui, and Taixi acupoints on the inner side of angles.\nHot pack: Relieve itchiness with hot packs.\nNight: Put a 45cmx30cm size red bean bag in the bed.

The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the cell receptor ACE2 via its spike protein, then it goes into the cell and causes infection. The virus usually infects human body via respiratory tract. Thus many people think it is a type of respiratory disease.\nHowever, this is not the case. Based on many facts, this virus attacks the organs all over our body. The research team, led by Yuyang Lei et al. from UC San Diego, published a paper on Circulation Research: SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Impairs Endothelial Function via Downregulation of ACE 2.\nThe research also indicated that COVID-19 is actually a vascular disease. It accurately proved how the SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks and damages the vascular system on a cellular level. The spike protein of the virus (S protein) will damage the vascular endothelial cells. Originally the tissue sample test indicated that the endothelial cells of the interior pulmonary artery wall were inflamed. The spike protein (S protein) damaged the cell by binding the ACE2 protein. This binding damaged the signal transduction between ACE2 and mitochondria, causing mitochondrial impairment and fragmentation. These discoveries helped to explain the seemingly unrelated syndromes that were actually caused by COVID-19.\nThe research team showed that though many people think COVID-19 is respiratory disease, it is actually a vascular disease. This also explained why some COVID patients got stroke, and why some patients developed health issues in the other parts of the body.\nAfter lots of clinical treatment of COVID for the past 2 years, I found that as long as the place inside our body is reachable by blood, it is also reachable by the virus. The COVID virus damages lots of blood vessels and causes lots of blockage in our blood vessels. Therefore, lots of ‚Äúroads‚Äù that connect our organs are blocked, causing hemoglobin and nutrients failing to arrive at these organs. The blood vessel blockage thus leads to organ hypoxia and failure.\nI noticed this phenomenon at the beginning of the pandemic when I started the free clinic program in Wuhan. So I started to use Manchurian Wildginger, a traditional Chinese medicine, to dredge the blockage in the blood vessels. This is also why China promotes the Angong Niuhuang pill to treat COVID, as it can clean the cerebral blood vessel clots, which can cause stroke. But it needs to be pointed out that the Angong Niuhuang pills in the recent years are not the same as the early version, where the three main ingredients in the new version are all replaced.\nRelated Reading (In Chinese)\nAngong Niuhuang Pill\nBridle,immunologist and associate professor at Guelph University, pointed out that though all the countries in the world set a 12 ~ 18 month research \u0026amp; development cycle for the COVID vaccine, the possibility of making one is very slim based on the statistics of past vaccine development life cycle. He said most vaccines need 10 years to develop on average.\nThe well-known British Medical Journal‚Äôs associate editor published a paper claiming that Jackson, a clinical research regional director of Ventavia, accused Pfizer of intentionally hiding issues occurred during the third phase of clinical research and development of the vaccine and there was experimental data fabrication during the R\u0026amp;D process.\nOne Canadian cancer vaccine researcher said that new research showed that after taking COVID vaccine, the spike protein of the COVID virus may accidentally go into our blood. This is a valid explanation of thousands of side effect reports - ranging from blood coagulation and heart diseases to cerebral damage and reproductive system issues. Recently the feedback of people getting COVID vaccine showed symptoms of fever, faintness, swelling and pain. Some people got the symptoms after 1~2 months of taking the shots, while others got the symptoms after half a year.\nByram Bridle, immunologist and associate professor at Guelph University, said during an interview with Alex Pierson that ‚Äúwe have made a big mistake and we just realized that‚Äù and he warned the public that his information was ‚Äúalarming‚Äù.\n‚ÄúWe thought that the spike protein is a very good target antigen. We did not know that the spike protein is a toxin itself, a pathogenic protein. Thus, by giving people vaccine shots, we unintentionally inject them with a type of toxin‚Äù.\nThe statistics of Japan showed that the notorious spike protein will enter the blood and circulates in the blood vessels for a few days after vaccination. Then it will accumulate in the body organs and tissues, including spleen, bone marrow, liver and adrenal glands. The ovary will also have a quite high concentration level of the protein. We already know that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein and a toxin, which will cause damage after entering the blood. This also explains why there are so many long-term symptoms after vaccination.\nOur Wechat public account has related posts explaining the mechanism of the vaccine, which everyone can take a look. So, as the most popular vaccine in the world, how is the Pfizer vaccine currently?\nAccording to the official statistics of Pfizer, 75% of the virus in the vaccine will enter the lymphatic system and will reach all the corners in the body. The vaccine loaded with over 40 trillion messenger RNA is injected into the human body and about 30 trillion will eventually connect via the lymphatic vessels and enter the blood after being absorbed by the cells.\nThese cells are usually distributed near the blood vessels, and enter the blood vessels through the network nearby the capillaries. Then the vaccine starts to work. The genes are starting to massively reproduce COVID spike protein. The purpose of the reproduction is to let the body identify the intruder protein, and generate proteins against it, thus preventing the infection of COVID virus. But there is an issue here. The spike protein is part of the viral envelope of the COVID virus, but it is not inside the virus in this scenario. Instead, it enters the blood and becomes part of the vascular endothelial cell wall.\nThese spike protein test the damaged blood vessels and block them. Platelets, whose main function is to stop bleeding, will think that the blood vessel starts bleeding and start coagulation process. This will inevitably cause blood clots. These blood clots form like cancer, as they contain carcinogens. Whether this is the case or not? D-dimer tests show that thousands of capillaries inside the lung are clotted, which means pulmonary hypertension (Once these kind of symptoms appear, the patient will die within 3 years of right-sided heart failure).\nThe heart works against huge resistance force in order for the blood to circulate to all over the body through the lung. Which is to say, many people get heart diseases. Apart from adding burden to the heart, some blood clots will go inside the heart, causing blockage in the heart in serious. At the same time, as too many blood vessels are blocked in the body, the heart takes too much pressure, which means vaccine-caused myocarditis. These kind of damages are permanent, and the body will never return to its original state. Currently with the demand of more vaccine shots, the damage will increase and the capillaries will continually getting damage.\n![WeChat Image_20220314225955](/img/complete-analysis-of-covid-vaccines.assets/WeChat Image_20220314225955.jpg)\nBased on the capabilities of existing medical devices, 62% people can be detected with visible thrombi. Some of the strokes that we see, are due to big chunks of cerebral thrombus. However, many tiny thrombi can not be detected, as they are too tiny and too scattered. People with these tiny thrombi will not know themselves, as there is no symptom. Some of our important organs, such as brain, lung, vertebrate and heart cannot regenerate after damage. Once their blood vessels are blocked and tissues damaged, the damage will be permanent. This is what we call tolerance reduced. So people with symptoms of medium severity level and above are more likely to feel difficulty in breathing. Some people with mild symptoms feel tired.\nAs for patients with severe symptoms, the best medicine is the old version of the Angong Niuhuang pills. Some people with mild to medium symptoms can use our #2 herbal medicine. The details can be found on our official website‚Äôs patient feedbacks. This medicine has been used by tens of thousands of people worldwide.\nOur life is very precious, and most important thing in life is health and safety. There is no way to try one more time. We need to seriously consider what is good for us. In this era, we already own a lot of things and it is time to give up something. Or we will give up health and safety.\nLittle doctor\nEND\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"posts","tags":["Vaccination sequelae"],"title":"Complete Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccines","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/posts/complete-analysis-of-covid-vaccines/"},{"content":"More and more people are getting cancer these years. Why? The reason is that once a tumor is identified, the treatment principles and methods are completely wrong. As a result, patients already going under a cancer treatment get new cancerous tumors while they are not fully recovered from the existing ones.\nThe author of this article consulted many medical cases from ancient and modern times, and wrote this article based on more than 10 years of experience in practicing medicine in Western countries, hoping to help patients who are in the terminal stage of cancer. The process of birth, aging, to illness and death is natural law, while recovery from illness is also a kind of natural law. Any synthetic treatment that separates and ultimately violates the law of nature is doomed to fail.\nThe current cancer treatment based on modern medicine is a three-step process in conventional hospitals ‚Äî surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. These methods are all about \u0026ldquo;killing\u0026rdquo; cancerous cells which are also destroying body‚Äôs natural healing abilities. According to the traditional medicine classic books, we should treat these major malignant diseases with ‚Äúpeace‚Äù and ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù of body‚Äôs natural existence. The yin and yang between heaven and earth is balanced and interconvertible. The cost will be extremely painful in the end if we disobey this principle.\nThe trilogy of the Western medicine 1. Surgery\nAs we all know, a \u0026ldquo;surgery\u0026rdquo; is performed to remove the cancerous lump. But malignant tumors are different from common tumors ‚Äì the malignant tumors tend to have infiltrates. So during a surgery, surgeons tend to remove more infiltrative soft tissues. Therefore, the physical damage to the organs and soft tissues deemed to inevitably aggravate. It is important to mention that the purpose of this article is not to be against surgery but to highlight the importance of decision making related to a surgery i.e. considering the patient\u0026rsquo;s age, symptoms, the location of the cancer block, and a comprehensive assessment of the risk that the surgical process entails.\n2. Radiotherapy\nTumor radiotherapy is a topical treatment method that uses radiation to treat tumors. Radiation includes radioactive isotope-produced Œ±-ray, Œ≤-ray, Œ≥-ray and x-ray, electronic ray, proton beams, and other particle beams produced by various x-ray treatment machines or accelerators.\nAbout 70% of cancer patients need radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer. Generally speaking, stage I and II are mainly radiotherapy, while stage III and IV are mainly chemotherapy. Topical radiotherapy can also be used in stage III and IV. However, as we know that radiotherapy kills both good and bad soft tissues at the same time. Therefore, patients in the terminal cancer stage cannot be treated with radiation as cancer cells are already spread to the whole body.\n3. Chemotherapy\n\u0026ldquo;Chemotherapy\u0026rdquo; is short for chemical drug therapy. It kills cancer cells by using chemical therapeutic drugs.\nOur bodies are made up of cells, and 80% of the cells are filled up with water. When we have physical problems, it is actually the water in the cells that has problems i.e. the nature of the water is changed from healthy to unhealthy. To understand this further, refer to Dr. Masaru Emoto‚Äôs ‚ÄúWater Knows Answers‚Äù experiment that helps explain how cancer is originated in the human body.\nRadiotherapy is difficult to exert effective treatment for potential metastatic lesions (cancer cells that have already spread to other parts of the body, but cannot be detected clinically because of the current technical limitations) and clinical metastases.\nChemotherapy is a method of systemic therapy. No matter by which way (oral, intravenous, body cavity administration, etc.) the chemical drugs are taken, chemotherapy drugs will circulate within the blood vessels and reach most organs and tissues throughout the body.\nChemotherapeutic drugs are \u0026ldquo;cytotoxic drugs\u0026rdquo;, which come with some toxic side effects. The most common ones are:\n1. Digestive system reaction: such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Among them, nausea and vomiting are the most common reactions to chemotherapy.\n2. Bone marrow suppression: such as leukocytes and thrombocytopenia.\n3. Hair loss: some chemotherapy drugs may cause hair loss.\nAfter all, chemotherapy is an intense treatment that suppresses cancer cells in a short period of time but with a risk of cancer cells rebounding rapidly within the near future. Therefore, clinicians should strictly grasp the chemotherapy implications, set standardized and reasonable formulation of chemotherapy programs, and take necessary preventive measures\nTraditional Chinese medicine ‚Ä¢ The trilogy and the recuperation of the mind Patients with tumor/cancer\nTraditional Chinese medicine pays more attention to the conditioning of the mind. Thus every doctor practicing the ancient traditional Chinese medicine does a variety of daily practices regarding the mind and body.\nIf a traditional Chinese medicine doctor does not perform body and mind cultivation practices daily, he/she cannot experience the secret within, and does not qualify as a good doctor. In other words, a doctor who can only write prescriptions is not considered to be a good doctor of the Traditional Chinese medicine.\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about the radiotherapy and chemotherapy in traditional Chinese medicine. These therapies were recorded in traditional Chinese medicine a long time ago, but because of the suppression of traditional medicine due to rapid development of the modern Western medicine, the development of the multiple traditional Chinese medicine divisions have been getting worse. Thus, the traditional Chinese medicine practice has gradually developed gaps between the new generations and the older generations.\nCancer ~ can be treated just as easily as a cold? So far in this article, we have discussed the principle and side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy as part of the Western medicine. Many people also ask the ultimate effect of the modern medicine. This is to be discussed in the following sections of this article. We take an example of cold. We are not afraid of getting cold but we are seriously afraid of developing cancer. This is because cold is not associated to serious implication like death. It can happen but generally cold does not cause a lot of deaths.\nWhy do more and more people get cancer? Why do more and more people die from cancer nowadays? Most of the cancer patients died in hospitals, as there was no cure to this serious disease. Western medicine has been developed for less than two hundred years, and it rose rapidly after the invention of antibiotics in World War II. With the development of technology in the Western medicine, the diagnosis methods are becoming more and more accurate while the treatment methods are not keeping up.\nThe treatment method is a weak point for cancer and certain chronic diseases. Therefore, everyone is very afraid of these diseases. Because the mortality rate is very high, the number of patients going into hospitals is more than patients discharged from hospitals, which causes people being afraid of even talking about cancer. If one day cancer becomes cold, will we still be afraid of it? What Chinese ancient medicine practitioners are aiming to do is to apply the principles of the ancient medicine into the cancer treatment process that makes cancer treatment as easy as cold.\n1„ÄÅTraditional Chinese Medicine Surgery ~ Review and Outlook So let\u0026rsquo;s begin to understand part of the history on surgery within the traditional Chinese medicine . The knowledge regarding surgery in traditional Chinese medicine was lost when Hua Tuo was killed, and his invention - Ma Fei Powder (powder for anesthesia) did not pass down since 200s AD. Because the anesthetic formula has not been handed down, the absence of anesthetic led to the downfall of the surgery specialty of traditional Chinese medicine.\nThe traditional Chinese medicine surgery can be said to be very scientific and medically professional. In ancient times, there was no modern equipment, for example, like X-ray, MIR and so on. The doctors had to rely on their own knowledge and intuitional power. One needs to reach a certain level of spirituality and attain inner balance in order to open the Third Eye. The third eye dynamism is very powerful. It allows a level of intuition that can see clearer and further than the X-ray. This is not just a story but a powerful mind and soul balance of the human existence. The ancient doctors applied this higher level of skill into their medical practices. Otherwise, how did the doctors in the ancient times dare to cut open the patient\u0026rsquo;s body with a surgery knife precisely at the location where it embodied the disease?\nDialectical thinking of traditional Chinese medicine is different from Western medicine. In traditional Chinese Medicine, the symptoms are dialectically diagnosed in detail with the theory of yin and yang, with \u0026ldquo;harmony\u0026rdquo;, ‚Äúreconciliation\u0026quot; to cure the disease, rather than the heavy use of surgery and synthetic medicines as in the Western medicine. As mentioned earlier, the traditional Chinese medicine also has surgery, but this surgery is based on the scientific yin, yang, and the five elements. It is more about considering the previous cause, the present issue, and planning for the results i.e. healing holistically.\nHowever, nowadays the invention of new technology and evolving scientific techniques, as well as advanced surgical technology, just made up for the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine. Today\u0026rsquo;s traditional Chinese medicine should boldly operate to restore the surgical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine since the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n2„ÄÅThe Chemotherapy Method of Traditional Chinese medicine ~ Traditional Chinese herbal medicine After seeing the chemotherapy of the Western medicine, we know that, in fact, the chemotherapy of the traditional Chinese medicine is the \u0026ldquo;traditional Chinese herbal medicine\u0026rdquo;. Yes, traditional Chinese herbal medicine reaches most organs and tissues through the blood circulation within the body.\nWe all know where \u0026ldquo;cancer\u0026rdquo; cells come from. They come from \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; cells. According to the law of nature, the conversion from \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; cells to \u0026ldquo;cancer\u0026rdquo; cells eventually affected the overall functional being of the patients. As a result, I saw a lot of patients getting weaker after chemotherapy, which eventually led to many unfortunate deaths. Therefore, according to the law of nature, we should \u0026ldquo;convert\u0026rdquo; those cancer cells back to good cells or develop new healthy cells to compensate the dead ones.\n3„ÄÅ Traditional Chinese medicine radiotherapy ~ Moxibustion Next, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the \u0026ldquo;radiotherapy\u0026rdquo; of traditional Chinese medicine. Now, we will focus on the \u0026ldquo;radiotherapy\u0026rdquo;. Next time we will talk about the \u0026ldquo;chemotherapy of traditional Chinese medicine,\u0026rdquo; if we get a chance.\nThe radiotherapy of traditional Chinese medicine has been used a long time ago, which is also called \u0026ldquo;moxibustion\u0026rdquo;. However, this theory of traditional Chinese Medicine has not been clearly elaborated, which led to this precious knowledge not being well explored in this era of science and technology, where modern principles of science is the only truth to lots of people.\nNow, we will use the principle of modern technology to explain the principle of the radiotherapy in the traditional Chinese medicine.\nMoxibustion has been used since ancient times. As an old saying goes, ‚Äúseven years of disease, three years of moxibustion\u0026quot;. In fact, through the ages, cancer has long been here since a long time ago, and it is not a modern disease. As for patients who are diagnosed with cancer just now, the cancer cells have started gathering in their bodies since many years ago.\n1 Tumor ~ slow in formation Normal people have cancer cells inside their bodies. Cancer cells maintain a balance with normal healthy cells. Every day new cancer cells are generated and some existing cancer cells die normally. When this balance is broken, the body is at low immunity. Generally, in about 5 years, the body would produce a large number of cancer cells. Eventually these cancer cells will form lumps in certain areas of the body.\nThe lump is like a ‚Äúsurface‚Äù which is generated by the \u0026ldquo;points\u0026rdquo; gathered together. So when we remove the \u0026ldquo;surface\u0026rdquo;, we cannot completely eliminate all the cancer cells at the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù in the body. This is why many patients‚Äô cancer relapsed soon after surgery. Cancer has a very slow process of development. It is not generated at once. When cancer is at the point of outbreak, the patient‚Äôs health suddenly collapses. In most cases, the patient cannot bear the psychological pressure.\nCancer finally destroys all the organs and tissues of the body. Also, as the pain caused by congestion consumes a lot of physical strength, the patient eventually dies because of physical exhaustion, immunity failure, and body organ failure. As cancer and other tumors are slowly formed, the removal process is also slow. This is why there is an old saying that says, \u0026ldquo;Diseases come on horseback but go away on foot‚Äù and ‚ÄúHaste makes waste \u0026ldquo;.\n2 The principle of moxa~ Far-infrared rays Next, we will talk about why moxa can cure diseases? It is because moxa can warm the meridians, benefit Qi(the vital energy that circulates through the body at all times), activate blood circulation and disperse colds. Why? Because moxa can release far - infrared rays when burning. But different moxa releases different far-infrared rays, and the requirements for moxa are different.\nWhat benefits do far-infrared rays offer to the body? Among the infrared rays, there is an infrared ray with a wavelength of 4ÔΩû14Œºm, which is called the far infrared ray. As a ray is the same wavelength as the organism itself, it is also known as ‚ÄúCultivated Light \u0026ldquo;. The far infrared ray produced by the combustion of moxa is close to the far-infrared ray that is produced by the human body itself.\nThe infrared ray‚Äôs wavelength of a healthy human body is 8-12Œºm. The heat energy generated after high temperature combustion of the wild moxa more than three years old (except the machine-made ones) has the function of far-infrared rays. It can play a warm effect which can keep the body warm and promote peripheral blood circulation, eventually promoting the systemic blood circulation of the entire body.\nWe often find that the peripheral blood circulation of unhealthy people is extremely poor, as their hands and feet are always cold. Doctors of traditional Chinese medicine usually touch patients\u0026rsquo; hands and feet to determine their physical health status.\nThe far infrared ray released by moxibustion has a relatively strong penetration power and can play a deep warm effect. This is why it is recorded in many medical books that good moxa can reach 8-10 cm of penetration under the skin, and with that deep distance of penetration, the far-infrared ray can directly reach the cancer lump.\nOn the right side of the figure above , there is a PET/CT image of a 68-year-old patient with advanced cancer, showing systemic spread of cancer cells. On the left side, there is also a PET/CT image of the same patient, after taking moxibustion for one and a half months with our 7 cm handmade wild moxa sticks. We found that 80% of the cancer cells disappeared, and some cancer cells spread to the bones and the head also disappeared.\n3 Penetrability of the far-infrared rays **Why does moxa have such a great effect? **\n3.1 Because the far-infrared rays produced by the combustion of moxa can infiltrate the human body and vibrate the water molecules within Which will convert into heat that increases the skin temperature, improving cellular vitality and blood circulation. Combining with nutrients and protein DNA, it will form new hydrates that are easier for digestion, which is excellent for one‚Äôs health and wellness.\nTherefore, it is recommended that everyone does outdoor activities often and get enough sun exposure. Unfortunately, most of us sit in the office for too long and lack sun exposures. In that case, moxa can be a good alternative to sunlight.\n3.2 The far-infrared rays produced by the combustion of moxa can improve the microcirculatory system. It creates lateral circulation, enhances the stability of cell membranes, regulates ion concentration, and improves osmolality. It speeds up the excretion of toxic substances and metabolites. Additionally, it accretes the absorption of the exudate that results in decreasing edema.\nOnce the microcirculatory system improves, metabolites can be excreted quickly, and therefore reducing the burden on the liver and kidney by quickly discharging the toxic waste. Such wastes include carcinogenic heavy metals, fatigue/aging-inducing lactic acid, free fatty acid and subdermal fat, uranium ions that cause high blood pressure, and uric acid that causes pain.\nIf the microcirculatory system is faulty, it can lead to many issues, including high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, tumor, arthritis, cold and numb limbs. Good blood circulation to different parts of the body can prevent soreness and discomfort, eliminate fatigue and other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, hyperplasia, adhesive capsulitis, cervicitis, back pain, and paralysis of hands and feet.\nAdditionally, far-infrared rays can purify blood, improve skin texture, prevent bone and joint pains caused by uric acid, and reduce the burden on the kidneys. The liver and kidney of cancer patients are extremely depleted. Moxa can ease and reduce such a burden while strengthening the liver and kidney. Typically, cancer patients start with issues occurring in the microcirculatory system, and then meridians are blocked, which eventually leads to blockage in the internal organs and finally forming tumors.\n3.3 Moxa can balance the PH levels of our body As mentioned in the last two paragraphs, the far-infrared rays can purify blood, improve skin texture, prevent bone and joint pains caused by uric acid, improve the blood circulation of different parts of the body, prevent soreness and discomfort, and eliminate fatigue. Moxibustion can cure many diseases such as rheumatic arthritis, hyperplasia, adhesive capsulitis, cervicitis, back pain, and paralysis of hands and feet.\n3.4 Activation of cellular functions and purification of blood. The far-infrared rays produced by the combustion of moxa can activate water molecules. The latest research has found that cellular hypoxia causes cancer, and the main reason for cellular hypoxia is that water molecules in the cell cannot penetrate the cell membrane (also known as the cell membrane is clogged). As a result, garbage in cells cannot be disposed freely.\nWater accounts for 70% of the human body and 80% of blood. If one is deficient in qi and blood, the water molecules in the blood then agglomerate into inert water that is unable to pass through the cell membrane. As a result, many cells will be dead, and some of the cells will turn into cancer cells.\nThe far-infrared rays can resonate with water molecules and become independent water molecules (combination of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). It improves the oxygen content in the human body. The cells are thus revitalized. As a result, a person becomes more energetic, smarter in thinking, more resistant to diseases, and the aging process is also slowed down.\n3.5 Lower free radicals The all-inclusive coverage and permeability of the far infrared rays produced by burning the moxa stick can generate a deep level thermal effect inside the body. It can activate cells, improve tissue regeneration, promote cell growth, strengthen liver function, and enhance liver detoxification.\nThe liver of cancer patients generally has poor detoxification functions. Moxa keeps the internal organ environment in good condition and improves the performance of the body\u0026rsquo;s self-circulatory system. It helps the body excrete in time the excess \u0026ldquo;free radicals\u0026rdquo; known as health killers.\n3.6 Prevent and assist in treating cancerous lesions Cancer cells have very weak resistance to high temperature. Using the penetrating power of far infrared rays, the thermal effect will not harm the surrounding normal cells, but the temperature can destroy cancer cells. Glandular cancer cells will die at the temperature of 38¬∞C; while 59% of cancer cells of general malignant tumors will die at a temperature of 43¬∞C.\nAs a result, many hospitals now have a new treatment method for cancer, which is to give fever shots to patients. The father of the Western medicine, Hippocrates, the ancient Greek saint of medicine, once said: Let me have a fever, and I will cure all diseases. Therefore, far infrared rays are good for inhibiting the spread of cancer cells, preventing and assisting in the treatment of cancer, and even treating persistent diseases that have not been cured for years.\n3.7 Activate immune cell functions The cancer cells have a strong ability to destroy the body organs. However, the heat effect of far-infrared rays released by the burning of moxa eliminates the pathological process of inflammation through the reaction of neurohumoral response. The original damaged physiological equilibrium is turning back to normal in accelerating speed, and the local and systemic disease resistance ability is heightened.\nIt also activates the function of immune cells and strengthens the phagocytosis of leukocytes and reticulocytes so as to decrease inflammation and restrain bacteria. The activation of immune cells can greatly fight against cancer cells. The world\u0026rsquo;s most expensive cancer injection treatment developed recently is based on the principle of stimulating immune T-cells to fight cancer cells. What we use costs much less and we can make this Chinese medicine available to any cancer patient. It is a radiation therapy that is affordable to all people.\nThe infrared heat effect produced by burning moxa increases the skin temperature, decreases sympathetic nerve sensing ability, releases vasoactive substances, dilates blood vessels, accelerates blood flow and improves blood circulation. It enhances tissue nutrition, activates tissue metabolism, increases cellular oxygen supply, improves blood and oxygen supply to the lesion area, strengthens the regenerative capacity of cells, controls the development of inflammation and localizes it, and accelerates the repair of the lesion.\n3.8 Analgesic Effect Many cancer patients experience a lot of painful reactions. The infrared heat effect generated by the burning of moxa reduces the excitability of nerve endings. It helps improve the blood circulation and decreases edema. It also reduces chemical and mechanical irritation of nerve endings. The thermal effect of the far infrared rays raises the pain threshold. All of the above play a role in relieving pain.\nWe know that many cancer patients eventually die from pain. Patients often go from taking dulcolax every 4 hours in the later stages to every 2 hours and then to 1 hour. This kind of pain is intolerable for common people. Other extremely serious patients, who although eventually passed away, died pain-free because of employing our moxibustion method in later stages. The quality of life in the last stage was greatly improved and dignity was also preserved for the deceased.\n3.9 Regulate blood pressure back to normal The warming effect of far-infrared rays produced by the burning of moxa can dilate the end blood vessels and promote blood circulation, so that the compression of blood vessels will be reduced and blood flow will become smoother, which can effectively help patients with hypertension to lower their blood pressure. While our daily use of antihypertensive drugs is based on the principle of vasodilatation, the sequelae is that, taking the drugs for more than a decade can easily lead to cardiovascular infarction.\n3.10 Regulate autonomic nervous system Cancer patients are under great stress and the mood of patients is especially important for their recovery. When a person is in a state of anxiety for a long time, the autonomic nervous system is constantly tense, which will lead to lower immunity, headache, dizziness, insomnia, weakness, and cold limbs. Far-infrared rays can regulate the autonomic nervous system and keep it in an optimal state, so that all of the above symptoms can be improved or removed. These are the tested effects of far-infrared rays on the human body produced by burning moxa.\n4 Air purification and sterilization In addition, the moxa smoke produced by burning moxa also has the effect of purifying the air, but it is necessary to choose the right moxa. If the moxa is not old enough, or if the processing method is not right, or if the moxa is added with plants such as artemisia absinthium or triphala, it is not only ineffective but also harmful. Note that \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo; moxa, moxa \u0026ldquo;of the year\u0026rdquo;, and moxa made for \u0026ldquo;commercial interests\u0026rdquo; are often toxic and are not able to achieve the medicinal effect. Instead, these types will backfire. The immune system of cancer patients is very low. Often, the surrounding environment is especially important to the patient\u0026rsquo;s recovery. The moxa smoke can kill typhoid, tuberculosis, staphylococcus and other germs in the air. The weather gets hot when spring changes into summer and it is the time for germs to multiply and become active. Burning moxa sticks to get rid of the germs at this time is more effective. In winter, when people‚Äôs immune system is at a lower level, burning moxa can also purify the surrounding environment.\n5 Moxa sticks made by the artist Finally, ancient people found that in the process of healing some chronic diseases, required moxa sticks made of plants that had been preserved for \u0026ldquo;three years\u0026rdquo;. The term \u0026ldquo;seven years\u0026rdquo; is a convenient term that refers to some chronic diseases in general.\nThe term \u0026ldquo;three-year old moxa\u0026rdquo; means that only the moxa sticks made from mugwort that had been stored for three years could achieve the ideal effect. In the past, there were no human planted mugwort plants; all were naturally grown in the wilderness. Therefore, \u0026ldquo;mugwort\u0026rdquo; should preferably be grown naturally. The \u0026ldquo;three years\u0026rdquo; here refers to the mugwort picked during the Dragon Boat Festival period because the mugwort picked during this period is the most potent as the flowers haven‚Äôt bloomed and the leaves are at their best form. Then, after three years of natural storage, the mugwort plant is hand-made into moxa sticks.\nTo guarantee its medicinal effectiveness, for more than ten years I have been doing research on making truly good medicinal moxa sticks. My team tries to replicate the ancient way of production. We purchase moxa naturally grown in the wilderness, then storing them for three years. Then we make the moxa sticks in the ancient way. Although the production procedure is complicated, we dare not save manpower; although the cost is high to achieve great quality, we dare not reduce material resources. To guarantee quality, we did dozens of experiments and finally succeeded in making good moxa after years of effort.\nThe traditional medicine of our homeland is extensive and deep. It‚Äôs a collection of experiences gained from the great nature by human beings over thousands of years. There is no need to do lab experiments as the natural practice and usage is in existence since ancient to current time period. A German medicine specialist told us that ‚Äúyour traditional medicine has been proven innumerous times on the human body through thousands of years in the past during medical practice. Therefore, you don‚Äôt need to experiment on white mice anymore.‚Äù\nGenuine medicine is blessed and a manifestation of Bodhisattvas. It is definitely able to help the mother-like sentient beings to be free of pain and obtain peace as well as happiness.\nLittle Doctor\nNov 4, 2021\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"difficultcases","tags":["Cancer Treatment","Moxibustion"],"title":"On Cancer \u0026 Tumor | The Painless Radiotherapy Method of Traditional Chinese Medicine","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/difficultcases/painless-radiotherapy/"},{"content":"Preface\nThis is a patient with advanced lung cancer who turned to Dr. Yang for help in April. The cancer had spread all over the body and metastasized to the bones. After Dr. Yang treating her for more than a month, she went for a PET/CT again. We can see that 70% of the cancer cells that had metastasized to the bones disappeared, and even the doctor examining the PET/CT image was amazed and asking how this good result was achieved.\nPatient\u0026rsquo;s family provided: patient\u0026rsquo;s PET/CT image diagnosis report In April of this year, my mother suddenly felt pain in her shoulder and back, and my family thought it was frozen shoulder. So she took some physical therapy visits. But after a few days, the pain came back, and it worsened, affecting her body movement. After a CT scan, the doctor told me that my mother had pathological fractures and the doctor suspected my mother got lung cancer, and that bone metastases had occurred. On hearing this news we were extremely shocked.\nProvided by the patient‚Äôs family: patient hospital-transfer approval I immediately arranged my mom to be transferred to the best hospital in town - the Affiliated Hospital to Southwest Medical University, where she had further tests in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, such as CT, chest puncture, genetic testing, etc. The final diagnosis was advanced lung cancer and bone metastases had occurred. My family and I were devastated.\nMy mother had no symptoms at all previous to her diagnosis and she was very healthy. She could walk 10 kilometers nonstop. How could she suddenly suffer from a terminal disease, and diagnosed as at the advanced stage? I was so shocked at the day of the bad news that I was unable to sleep for five days in a row and lost 8 pounds. I am 40 years old and have never been unable to sleep. This news hit me extremely hard.\nAt this time, I told my best friend, Mr. Cai, who recommended Dr. Yang to us while comforting us. I met Dr. Yang in 2015 once and he helped me to improve my health. Dr. Yang immediately contacted me via WeChat, and after understanding my situation, asked me two questions, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to save your mom? Are you willing to trust me?\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to accept him and trust him. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing good deeds and accumulating good merit, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rescuing stray cats and dogs, rescuing left-behind children, and raising money for good cause, etc. I think this is due to my accumulated good merit.\nDr. Yang immediately told me about the regimen and precautions.\nStep 1: Let mom fast.\nStep 2: Dr. Yang taught me how to do moxibustion and told me to start doing it right away (I happened to have Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s homemade moxibustion strips which I bought earlier).\nAt first, I was confused about the fasting program, thinking, \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we give her more nutrition? How come she wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to eat? But I was determined to trust Dr. Yang. We followed the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions to the letter. Strangely enough, on the third day of fasting, which was also the third day after the moxibustion, my mom was not in pain anymore. The body pain turned into soreness and swelling, and we became more confident and more determined to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s treatment plan.\n(Translation of the image above: This is an advanced lung cancer patient accepted by Dr. Yang in April. As shown in the photo, the cancer has spread to the whole body, even to the bones. Many doctors had said that it was incurable. The patient came to Dr. Yang for help. Dr. Yang treated her for more than a month. When she did a body scan again we can see that 70% of the cancer cells metastasized to the bone had disappeared. Even the examination doctor asked what they did to achieve this. I asked Dr. Yang many times and he told me that one of the important points was to use Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. I know about Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. He wanted to make moxa sticks himself in the early 2000s. However, for the past 18 years, the cause and conditions were not sufficient to make them. Dr. Yang traveled all over China and bought almost all the moxa sticks he could buy. In order to make good moxa, he went to the rural countryside, and stayed in the hand-made moxa production workshop, eating and sleeping on site*. The current situation of domestic moxa production is very complicated. The genuine* three-year-long moxa is very rare; in so many years I have only seen one genuine five-year moxa seller, and honestly speaking, I have no five-year moxa myself. Currently, almost all so-called ‚Äúwild moxa‚Äù are replaced by farm-produced moxa in the moxa market. In terms of the production process, the machine-made golden moxa replaced the original hand-made moxa. 100kg of Chinese mugwort can only produce 35kg of moxa if hand-made, whereas 90kg of moxa can be generated if made by machines. In order to look good, the machine-made moxa are all baked in high temperature to get the golden color. However, in this process, 30% of the moxa‚Äôs medicinal effect is lost and the moxa will produce a lot of smoke during moxibustion. As machine-made moxa come from Chinese mugwort which are not grown old enough, these moxa are quite humid. Moreover, one-year grown Chinese mugwort is even somewhat toxic. Dr. Yang always believes that only good medicine can cure illness so he never saves on the medicine cost. The moxa made this time are not planned to make commercial profits, so there is no saving on the production cost of the moxa. The moxa Dr. Yang made received good reviews from a small group of users and are exported to countries such as France, Canada, the U.S., and Spain. )\nDr. Yang taught us the location of the specific acupoints and the ordering of which acupoint to do moxibustion first. Every day my father and I took turns to do it for my mother. At first, in order to help dredge my mother‚Äôs meridians as soon as possible, every day we did moxibustion for every acupoint for more than half an hour. As for the important acupoints, we did moxibustion for more than an hour on each of them. Every day we did two rounds of moxibustion ( finishing all the acupoints in the right order was regarded as one round ), which took us basically 9 hours a day to complete.\nI got up after 5 am to make breakfast for my mother the way Dr. Yang told me. Then I did the standing stumps practice (Zhan Zhuang) and sitting meditation with her together. After that I went out for exercise and walking. After coming home and taking a short rest, I started the daily moxibustion treatment for my mother. I gave my mother fresh fruit and vegetable juice as supplements during the process. At noon, I gave my mother coarse grains and fresh vegetables for lunch, and I strictly avoided all meat in her diet. In the afternoon, I gave her a little bit of tremella lily soup. There was no dinner, and no food after 7 pm for my mother. In the first three days she was not adapted to it and felt hungry at night. Later she got used to it.\nLater, I received the herbal medicine prepared by Dr. Yang. My mother had nausea and vomited in the first two days of taking the medicine, but the symptoms stopped since the third day. After taking the medicine for a week, I sent a photo of my mother‚Äôs tongue to Dr. Yang for examination, and the appearance of her tongue indicated improvement. Dr. Yang told me: ‚ÄúKeep everything the same. Other than that, she could eat some fresh vegetables at night, just a little bit.‚Äù After another week, my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue appearance indicated huge improvement again. Then Dr. Yang asked us to change to another type of moxibustion. He changed the acupoints and adjusted the herbal medicine in our treatment plan.\nMy mother used to feel tired right away whenever she started any physical exercise after being diagnosed with cancer, like a cell phone which can only function for 5 minutes after charging 2 hours. Now she shows great improvement. We clearly feel that she has more energy - her voice is getting louder, and her spirit is getting better. Our whole family feels a little relieved. Day after day, on the 21st day, there was an incident. Dr. Yang suddenly noticed that the photo of my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue showed regression in health conditions. He immediately talked to me on the phone to check the recent situation and then asked me to stop the targeted drugs, as my mother had been taking the targeted drugs prescribed by the hospital at the same time, which were quite harmful to the liver. The harm done was reflected in my mother‚Äôs tongue photo and Dr. Yang noticed this astutely in time. After discussing with my family, I decided to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s advice and let my mother stop the targeted drugs, which was a bold decision based on my strong trust in Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical ethics and skills.\nA mother‚Äôs son\n2021.06\n","description":"","id":16,"section":"difficultcases","tags":["Cancer Treatment"],"title":"Real storyÔΩúMom's anti-cancer diary (Part one)","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/difficultcases/mom-cancer-diary-1/"},{"content":"‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà Today, after overcoming all kinds of obstacles, conquering all kinds of difficulties, and taking all kinds of risks, Dr. Yang and his team decided to post this Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements (TCM) prescription here in hopes of helping more people in prevention:\nFor healthy adults, take this prescription twice a day for 7 days; for adults of poor health, take this prescription twice a day for 10-14 days.\nAccording to statistics published by the Ministry of Commerce of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, by the end of March 2020, in addition to 1.43 million International students, there are at least 744 thousand Chinese citizens working and living overseas. Considering that most of these people are stranded abroad due to the changes in China‚Äôs entry policies, adjusted flights, and financial difficulties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, many enterprises and communities are actively participating in disaster relief.\nBy June 21, 2020, over 8.7 million coronavirus cases and 460 thousand deaths had been reported across the globe. With the help of volunteers, by June 13, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had provided free medical services for 720 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations provided reaching 1504, whereas, by June 21, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had helped 989 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in North America, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations hitting 2152. Dr. Yang‚Äôs dispensation of over 240 thousand concentrated powered of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had seen zero deaths among those patients. The youngest patient is only one month old, while the oldest is 82 years old ‚Äì their recoveries were confirmed by negative COVID-19 test results. Many infected Chinese people abroad as well as non-Chinese received by Dr. Yang and his team are recovering consecutively. None of them were seen to have serious post-COVID long-term syndrome. Nor did previous coronavirus patients in Wu Han, China, also received by Dr. Yang nearly three months ago, report any reinfection cases. But for the help of over 100 volunteers in Dr. Yang‚Äôs team, these would be unachievable.\nPerhaps the bereaved families who lost their loved ones suffer much more than death once the coronavirus has long-term impacts on these people, thought Dr. Yang. Since the Ministry of Health in different countries agreed that COVID vaccines are expected as soon as early next year, then what can we do since the vaccines are still half a year away?\nActually, the Eastern Han Dynasty had experienced over 300 pandemics. What did our ancestors do, and what will they do confronting the worldwide pandemics today? It is noteworthy that our ancestors had accumulated rich experiences to fight the pandemics and conquered numerous pandemics by self-quarantining, locking down and tossing limestone powder, etc.\nWith those cases in Wu Han, China again demonstrated to the world the value of TCM, containing within it five thousand years of Chinese wisdom and culture. Not only did it rescue people from hanging upside down, but it also promoted economic recovery in Wu Han and in China. Certainly, China has more cultural values - as priceless as antique collections - to show people all over the world just when they need it most and just when they suffer most.\nWith the development of science and technology, human beings are able to discover state-of-the-art vaccines. However, what are vaccines? Vaccines refer to bio-products derived from different pathogenic microorganisms to prevent and control all kinds of pandemics. They can be divided into live (attenuated) virus vaccines and killed (inactivated) vaccines. Common live virus vaccines include Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Measles, and plague vaccine, etc., while common killed vaccines include Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus, typhoid fever, Meningococcus, and Cholera Vaccine, etc. It usually takes one to two years to develop a new type of vaccine, by weakening or inactivating the pathogenic microorganism, or providing the genetic code for part of the pathogenic microorganism to prevent and control the pandemics.\nDuring the primary immune response to the first encounter with the unharmful pathogen, the immune system produces protective substances such as immunization hormones, active physiological substances, special antigens, etc., to protect the body. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. To put it more simply, vaccination is to use weakened, the unharmed virus that does not cause serious disease in people to enable the immunization to recognize and fight against the virus, so that the immune system will react to and fight infections automatically in the future. That‚Äôs why live, attenuated vaccines might cause fever and some other symptoms in weakened immunization systems. It is a war, an inflammatory storm between the immunization system and the virus.\nNow we understand that it is our own immunization systems that fight against those invading enemies. In other words, a vaccine cannot work without our immunity. Vaccinations are used to ‚Äútrain,‚Äù and ‚Äúeducate‚Äù the immune system in order to ultimately fight the infections. This teaches us that as long as our immunization cells are ‚Äúwell-learned,‚Äù our bodies produce antibodies to react to the viruses whenever they attack us again.\nHence, can we say that TCM may also function as a form of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù?\nThe way doctors of TCM think is a composition of Taiji Yin-Yang philosophy in Taoism and form-and-emptiness philosophy in Buddhism. For example, when one is asked ‚ÄúWhere is the east,‚Äù the answer is, ‚ÄúThere, the west is, where are the heart and spirit? There is seven Level of Quest for heart and spirit ‚Äì no facet of life remains outside your spiritual growth and vision.‚Äù\nIn fact, the profundity of TCM lies in its preservation of one‚Äôs state of being/health, rather than the treatment of the disease, for it is already too late when the disease invades the body. People with strong immunity, as mentioned in the previous article on the Wechat media platform, recover soon with the help of TCM. However, the problem today is that people are ignorant of staying healthy and clutch at a straw the moment they are drowning - seriously ill. One of the coronavirus patients in the United States posted his medical bills ‚Äì the amount is up to over 110 million dollars. He might be unable to pay off the debts even by using up his saving for a lifetime. Comparatively speaking, preservation of one‚Äôs being/health is much cheaper. The most important part of the preservation of one‚Äôs being/heart lies in the preservation of one‚Äôs heart and spirit, which is not only cheap but also effective.\nDr. Yang and his team referenced multiple ancient books of TCM. One day, at dawn, it suddenly occurred to Dr. Yang that the virus can be mitigated and killed by strengthening people‚Äôs immunity, and thus the TCM then used to strengthen people‚Äôs immunity will be called the TCM vaccine. Now our primary concern is to find the Chinese herbal prescription to strengthen people‚Äôs immune function. After rounds of discussions, analyses, and research, Dr. Yang and his team chose a classic prescription from ancient China. It is this TCM vaccine that saved accompanying family members in Wu Han, and medical workers in Wu Han, New York, Montr√©al, and Britain from being infected. Some Western medical workers start to get curious about the TCM vaccine; their trial of it saved them from infections. One medical worker, whose health condition is but of average level, was seen to have fully recovered within two weeks after taking the TCM prescription. Facts speak louder than words. A myriad of examples has proved the reliability of this TCM prescription.\nIn the middle of the following March 2020, we applied our approach and theory to the overseas market and provided TCM prescriptions to patients, their families, and medical workers. The surge in COVID-19 cases overseas witnessed many new symptoms that are different than those in Wu Han. The first time the COVID-19 overseas were found to get more severe and start to attack people‚Äôs central nervous systems, our team felt more anxious than ever, waiting for the feedback. Time flies. One month later, the clinical experience from the frontier and has brought positive feedback: among those medical workers who use our No 1. prescription, nobody was reported to have infected the virus. The test results showed that many people already had antibodies in their blood, proving the validity of the TCM vaccine.\nThis discovery overthrows the previous Western-dominated medical theories and illustrates with successful clinical experiences not only the new Chinese perspective but also the power of TCM. In addition, the secret about TCM lies in its dosage: people with different body constitutions and different symptoms should take different dosages at different times. The ultimate purpose, though, is to strengthen the immunity of the body.\nDr. Yang\n2020-06-22\n","description":"","id":17,"section":"posts","tags":["Preventive Herbs"],"title":"Preventive Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/posts/tcm-vaccine/"}]
