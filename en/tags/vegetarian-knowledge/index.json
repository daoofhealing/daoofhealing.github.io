[{"content":"01 Lingering fears As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;Women are weak, but mothers are strong.\u0026quot; The dark cloud of COVID-19 had overshadowed Canada for more than a month. The one-year-old child had a lasting fever, diarrhea, and was wailing. The pediatrician said that if the virus caused it, there was no medicine to treat it; the child could only pull through it. Even non-parents would understand the mother\u0026rsquo;s anxiety and worries at this time.\nAlthough considered shrewd and capable in her family\u0026rsquo;s and friends' eyes, Alice still feels scared when she recalls this experience.\n02 It might be a virus Playing back the experience from April 7, our baby turned one year old, I took him to a pediatric clinic for a vaccine. The doctor told me that the child might have a fever in a few days. I didn\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. The baby had been vaccinated before, and after a short-term fever, he was fine within 24 hours. Unexpectedly, on the sixth day, the baby suddenly developed a fever of about 39°C.He was given Tylenol every four hours, but his body temperature only dropped to about 37.5°C, before a high fever rose again. The next day diarrhea started; tongue sores appeared; he was unwilling to drink milk or anything else. He was just lying on my shoulders and continuously \u0026ldquo;wailing\u0026rdquo; (I can only describe the child\u0026rsquo;s voice like this).\nI called the doctor. “Is this a response from the vaccine?” I asked. The doctor answered it was impossible. A baby may have a fever from the seventh to the tenth day after vaccination, but the fever will go away within 24 hours and not last five consecutive days. I became very nervous and asked the doctor what to do. The doctor supposed it was an acute baby rash. When the baby was three months old, he had a baby rash combined with a fever lasting five or six days. Now in the fifth day, no rash had appeared. The doctor said that I could come again, but I had to wait two days. During the pandemic, the practice was not open every day.\nMy husband and I took the child to see a doctor. The doctor said it might be a virus, and the virus may cause symptoms of tongue sores and diarrhea. We were very nervous. What virus was it? The doctor said he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the virus was; if the virus caused it, there was no cure for it, and the child could only fight it off by himself. We didn\u0026rsquo;t dare to think about COVID-19. Since mid-March, we had not been out except for the baby’s vaccination. We had been at home for almost a month. Was there a virus in the clinic? At that time, COVID-19 was not easily detectable, nor could every one test accurately in perceived suspected cases.\nI fell into a panic. The baby had a high fever for five days, and he could not take anti-fever medication every day.\n03 After all that, should I give the medicine to my baby? Then I thought of Dr. Yang. About a week or two before my baby got sick, I paid particular attention to his team and even planned to volunteer, but the baby was so fussy that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time. At this point, I thought perhaps Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine might relieve the symptoms caused by the unknown virus?\nOnce again, I contacted Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s volunteer team. With their warm-hearted help, I filled out a form for the first online consultation. Dr. Yang advised on the same day: treatment started immediately with 1g herbal mixture twice daily for three days. Following the consultation process, patients have to wait for their medication to be delivered, but the volunteers organized a pick-up. After my husband brought the medicine home, I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby. After all, the baby was only one year old, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if the cause was COVID-19.\n04 Enduring the distress Again， I contacted Xiangang, the leader of the volunteer team, to express my concerns. **What if this was the wrong medication and aggravated the illness? **Xianggang reassured me, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; Chinese medicine treats the symptoms and gets to the root of the problem. The herbal mixture is not aimed at a state of a disease but rather at improving immunity. No matter what the virus is, a strengthened immune system will fight it off naturally.\u0026rdquo;\nTaking himself as an example,he said he had had rhinitis for a long time. After taking Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine, the rhinitis symptoms reduced significantly. This medicine is not for rhinitis, but the improved immunity helped him. I thought Xiangang was right, and I felt assured enough to give this medicine to the baby once. The baby was too young to take the medication actively. It was even challenging to get him to drink some water. I had to give him the preparation by mouth with a syringe.\n05 The change The first time I gave the medicine, I noticed the baby began to sweat a lot. After that, the baby fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. Touching his forehead, the baby had no fever anymore. In the past, after taking an antipyretic, his temperature dropped to about 37.6°Cand rebounded with a high fever later, but the temperature rarely fell below 37°C. I’ve read some information about Traditional Chinese Medicine, inducing sweat and relieving superficies stimulates inner circulation and reduces fever.\nThe day after the baby took the medicine, he had diarrhea again. I became afraid and contacted Xiangang immediately. He quickly put me in touch with Dr. Yang. I asked if the baby should continue to take medicine for the remaining two days. The doctor said with confidence that we must stick to it. I must dig my toes in to finish giving him the medication for three days. By the end of the third day, the child had no fever, the sores on his tongue resolved, the rashes on his legs cleared up, and most importantly, diarrhea was relieved. I think perhaps the child\u0026rsquo;s strengthened immunity had overcome the virus.\nIn the second consultation, Dr. Yang said that diarrhea is sometimes a good thing (I think it\u0026rsquo;s a detoxification process.) Doctor Yang says it\u0026rsquo;s best to take preventive medication for three more days to establish health. After taking the preventive medication, the child no longer had any symptoms. So far, I felt that I had made the right choice.\n06 Can you share this experience? Two days ago, Xiangang contacted me again and asked if I could share this experience. I said I strongly supported it. I hope that some other patients will benefit from our baby\u0026rsquo;s case. This medicine is more like a nutritional supplement that improves immunity. The baby is very energetic now, babbling like music every day, and sometimes his voice can overwhelm my voice. The gratitude in my heart is beyond words.\nI wish people in the world would be as pure and clear as babies and let the light of life drive away the pandemic\u0026rsquo;s haze.\nA mother’s contribution\n","description":"I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby.

Not only does it affect the global economy and change everyone\u0026rsquo;s life and workstyle, but it also affects our physical and mental health. After nearly two years of a silent war against the epidemic and the promotion of vaccination, the epidemic seems to be at a turning point.\nEveryone seems to have been adapted to and accepted the new way of getting along with the epidemic, and no longer \u0026ldquo;fear the epidemic\u0026rdquo;; or we think that after we get vaccinated, we will have antibodies to protect us from the virus. However, who could have predicted that a special \u0026ldquo;product of the epidemic era\u0026rdquo; would quietly arise and lurk in our bodies?\nIt is the \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - the \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;. This type of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; is a side effect of the coronavirus vaccine, similar to allergies, eczema, rubella, measles, hives, chicken pox or shingles. For the time being, there seems to be no accurate answer, and it is up to the medical professionals to investigate.\nHere I would like to share my experience of fighting the rash. It’s just for your reference**. Some of my friends also experienced the rash after the vaccination, but the timing and symptoms of the rash varied from person to person. So was the treatment and recovery period.** It took me about 3 months after the vaccination to get this \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo;.\nA Friendly Reminder\nIf you have this kind of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; symptom, please seek medical attention immediately. Follow the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions and cooperate with the treatment for early recovery. Remember there is an old saying: \u0026ldquo;A disease should be treated when symptoms are still very light, and let a disease untreated is like watching a tiger growing up.”\nSeek prompt medical attention for \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo; On September 27, 2021, which was a Monday afternoon, I felt a little bit itchy on my back and didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to it. After midnight, I felt that my whole spine and shoulders were hot, and my back was covered with a thick red rash. The itch was unbearable and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep, but fortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fever.\nIn the morning of September 28, I immediately contacted Dr. Yang and received medical treatment from him. Within 4 days, I was almost fully recovered and the rash was all gone.\nPhysical, mental and dietary adjustments I think when dealing with any illness, the first and foremost thing to do is to calm your mind. As mental health directly affects physical health, it is important to keep a positive mindset when being sick. Secondly, it is important to adjust the body through diet and exercise, so that a strong and healthy body can resist the disease.\nAdjust your diet according to Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical advice  Eat light. Do not eat seafood, shrimp, crab, and eat less meat. (Remark: I am a vegetarian.) Do not eat cold and raw food: apples, bananas, pears, and oranges. Above food must be stewed and served hot. Eat some medically mild food: tomatoes, fungus, dark green vegetables/cauliflower; drink warm water/soup, and take ginger soup when needed. Do not eat spicy and greasy food. Drink as much warm water as possible after moxibustion.  Physical exercises generate Yang of one’s body During the treatment of \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;, I was severely sleep-deprived, and I felt very tired and wanted to sleep during the day. However, I continued to do appropriate indoor exercises in the morning and in the evening. Such as BaDuanJin Qigong, shaking hands at least 200 times, vertical jumping 70-100 times, squatting and standing up at least 50 times, etc. I tried not to do outdoor activities and avoid the wind.\nEvery time after these exercises, my whole body felt warm and hot. This is the so-called \u0026ldquo;movement can produce Yang\u0026rdquo;. I think these exercises can improve our blood circulation and inject some natural heat energy into the body. With the proper heat, it boosts our metabolism and helps our body to recover.\nCommonalities and differences in rashes Commonality: Sleepless \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash is active during the second half of the night, and is particularly itchy and disruptive to sleep.\nDifferences: Wandering \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash wanders and stays in various parts of the body with different symptoms.\n### My 4-day anti-rash record Day 1 Tuesday, September 1\nNeck rash ⬆️\nRash on arms ⬆️\nRash on the outside of legs⬆️\nRash on the inner side of legs ⬆️\nSymptoms: Red, itchy, and hot rashes appear around the neck, on the back, and on both sides of arms and legs.\nDon’t: wash with cold water or scratch with fingers.\nMoxibustion alternatively: Mingmen, Dazhui, and Taixi acupoints on the inner side of angles.\nHot pack: Relieve itchiness with hot packs.\nNight: Put a 45cmx30cm size red bean bag in the bed.

We must know our own body, adjust ourselves in all aspects, follow the doctor’s medical advice and cooperate in the treatment to achieve the best results.\nThe fact that my rashes went away and I fully recovered in a very short period of time is due to Doctor Yang’s timely treatment and valuable advice. The best description of Doctor Yang is a doctor with kind heart and kind treatment approach. May all the people in the world be safe and healthy! May all beings in the world live in harmony!\nOct 4th, 2021 in Toronto\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["Canada","Vaccination sequelae"],"title":"[Canada] Coronavirus Vaccination | My journey of anti-rash","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/posts/anti-rash/"},{"content":"Herbal Supplement Qualifications   All those free herbal supplements are nutrients extracted from natural plants using high-tech, regulating the human body\u0026rsquo;s internal environment, and improving its immune function.\n  The pharmaceutical factory of supplements has obtained GMP certification, international ISP9001/2000 certification, ISO17025 TAF international laboratory certification, ILAC-MRA certification, IA certification, APLAC certification.

The cancer had spread all over the body and metastasized to the bones. After Dr. Yang treating her for more than a month, she went for a PET/CT again. We can see that 70% of the cancer cells that had metastasized to the bones disappeared, and even the doctor examining the PET/CT image was amazed and asking how this good result was achieved.\nPatient\u0026rsquo;s family provided: patient\u0026rsquo;s PET/CT image diagnosis report In April of this year, my mother suddenly felt pain in her shoulder and back, and my family thought it was frozen shoulder. So she took some physical therapy visits. But after a few days, the pain came back, and it worsened, affecting her body movement. After a CT scan, the doctor told me that my mother had pathological fractures and the doctor suspected my mother got lung cancer, and that bone metastases had occurred. On hearing this news we were extremely shocked.\nProvided by the patient’s family: patient hospital-transfer approval I immediately arranged my mom to be transferred to the best hospital in town - the Affiliated Hospital to Southwest Medical University, where she had further tests in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, such as CT, chest puncture, genetic testing, etc. The final diagnosis was advanced lung cancer and bone metastases had occurred. My family and I were devastated.\nMy mother had no symptoms at all previous to her diagnosis and she was very healthy. She could walk 10 kilometers nonstop. How could she suddenly suffer from a terminal disease, and diagnosed as at the advanced stage? I was so shocked at the day of the bad news that I was unable to sleep for five days in a row and lost 8 pounds. I am 40 years old and have never been unable to sleep. This news hit me extremely hard.\nAt this time, I told my best friend, Mr. Cai, who recommended Dr. Yang to us while comforting us. I met Dr. Yang in 2015 once and he helped me to improve my health. Dr. Yang immediately contacted me via WeChat, and after understanding my situation, asked me two questions, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to save your mom? Are you willing to trust me?\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to accept him and trust him. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing good deeds and accumulating good merit, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rescuing stray cats and dogs, rescuing left-behind children, and raising money for good cause, etc. I think this is due to my accumulated good merit.\nDr. Yang immediately told me about the regimen and precautions.\nStep 1: Let mom fast.\nStep 2: Dr. Yang taught me how to do moxibustion and told me to start doing it right away (I happened to have Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s homemade moxibustion strips which I bought earlier).\nAt first, I was confused about the fasting program, thinking, \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we give her more nutrition? How come she wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to eat? But I was determined to trust Dr. Yang. We followed the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions to the letter. Strangely enough, on the third day of fasting, which was also the third day after the moxibustion, my mom was not in pain anymore. The body pain turned into soreness and swelling, and we became more confident and more determined to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s treatment plan.\n(Translation of the image above: This is an advanced lung cancer patient accepted by Dr. Yang in April. As shown in the photo, the cancer has spread to the whole body, even to the bones. Many doctors had said that it was incurable. The patient came to Dr. Yang for help. Dr. Yang treated her for more than a month. When she did a body scan again we can see that 70% of the cancer cells metastasized to the bone had disappeared. Even the examination doctor asked what they did to achieve this. I asked Dr. Yang many times and he told me that one of the important points was to use Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. I know about Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. He wanted to make moxa sticks himself in the early 2000s. However, for the past 18 years, the cause and conditions were not sufficient to make them. Dr. Yang traveled all over China and bought almost all the moxa sticks he could buy. In order to make good moxa, he went to the rural countryside, and stayed in the hand-made moxa production workshop, eating and sleeping on site*. The current situation of domestic moxa production is very complicated. The genuine* three-year-long moxa is very rare; in so many years I have only seen one genuine five-year moxa seller, and honestly speaking, I have no five-year moxa myself. Currently, almost all so-called “wild moxa” are replaced by farm-produced moxa in the moxa market. In terms of the production process, the machine-made golden moxa replaced the original hand-made moxa. 100kg of Chinese mugwort can only produce 35kg of moxa if hand-made, whereas 90kg of moxa can be generated if made by machines. In order to look good, the machine-made moxa are all baked in high temperature to get the golden color. However, in this process, 30% of the moxa’s medicinal effect is lost and the moxa will produce a lot of smoke during moxibustion. As machine-made moxa come from Chinese mugwort which are not grown old enough, these moxa are quite humid. Moreover, one-year grown Chinese mugwort is even somewhat toxic. Dr. Yang always believes that only good medicine can cure illness so he never saves on the medicine cost. The moxa made this time are not planned to make commercial profits, so there is no saving on the production cost of the moxa. The moxa Dr. Yang made received good reviews from a small group of users and are exported to countries such as France, Canada, the U.S., and Spain. )\nDr. Yang taught us the location of the specific acupoints and the ordering of which acupoint to do moxibustion first. Every day my father and I took turns to do it for my mother. At first, in order to help dredge my mother’s meridians as soon as possible, every day we did moxibustion for every acupoint for more than half an hour. As for the important acupoints, we did moxibustion for more than an hour on each of them. Every day we did two rounds of moxibustion ( finishing all the acupoints in the right order was regarded as one round ), which took us basically 9 hours a day to complete.\nI got up after 5 am to make breakfast for my mother the way Dr. Yang told me. Then I did the standing stumps practice (Zhan Zhuang) and sitting meditation with her together. After that I went out for exercise and walking. After coming home and taking a short rest, I started the daily moxibustion treatment for my mother. I gave my mother fresh fruit and vegetable juice as supplements during the process. At noon, I gave my mother coarse grains and fresh vegetables for lunch, and I strictly avoided all meat in her diet. In the afternoon, I gave her a little bit of tremella lily soup. There was no dinner, and no food after 7 pm for my mother. In the first three days she was not adapted to it and felt hungry at night. Later she got used to it.\nLater, I received the herbal medicine prepared by Dr. Yang. My mother had nausea and vomited in the first two days of taking the medicine, but the symptoms stopped since the third day. After taking the medicine for a week, I sent a photo of my mother’s tongue to Dr. Yang for examination, and the appearance of her tongue indicated improvement. Dr. Yang told me: “Keep everything the same. Other than that, she could eat some fresh vegetables at night, just a little bit.” After another week, my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue appearance indicated huge improvement again. Then Dr. Yang asked us to change to another type of moxibustion. He changed the acupoints and adjusted the herbal medicine in our treatment plan.\nMy mother used to feel tired right away whenever she started any physical exercise after being diagnosed with cancer, like a cell phone which can only function for 5 minutes after charging 2 hours. Now she shows great improvement. We clearly feel that she has more energy - her voice is getting louder, and her spirit is getting better. Our whole family feels a little relieved. Day after day, on the 21st day, there was an incident. Dr. Yang suddenly noticed that the photo of my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue showed regression in health conditions. He immediately talked to me on the phone to check the recent situation and then asked me to stop the targeted drugs, as my mother had been taking the targeted drugs prescribed by the hospital at the same time, which were quite harmful to the liver. The harm done was reflected in my mother’s tongue photo and Dr. Yang noticed this astutely in time. After discussing with my family, I decided to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s advice and let my mother stop the targeted drugs, which was a bold decision based on my strong trust in Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical ethics and skills.\nA mother’s son\n2021.06\n","description":"","id":12,"section":"difficultcases","tags":["Cancer Treatment"],"title":"Real story｜Mom's anti-cancer diary (Part one)","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/difficultcases/mom-cancer-diary-1/"},{"content":"中文版 Today, after overcoming all kinds of obstacles, conquering all kinds of difficulties, and taking all kinds of risks, Dr. Yang and his team decided to post this Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements (TCM) prescription here in hopes of helping more people in prevention:\nFor healthy adults, take this prescription twice a day for 7 days; for adults of poor health, take this prescription twice a day for 10-14 days.\nAccording to statistics published by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, by the end of March 2020, in addition to 1.43 million International students, there are at least 744 thousand Chinese citizens working and living overseas. Considering that most of these people are stranded abroad due to the changes in China’s entry policies, adjusted flights, and financial difficulties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, many enterprises and communities are actively participating in disaster relief.\nBy June 21, 2020, over 8.7 million coronavirus cases and 460 thousand deaths had been reported across the globe. With the help of volunteers, by June 13, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had provided free medical services for 720 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations provided reaching 1504, whereas, by June 21, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had helped 989 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in North America, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations hitting 2152. Dr. Yang’s dispensation of over 240 thousand concentrated powered of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had seen zero deaths among those patients. The youngest patient is only one month old, while the oldest is 82 years old – their recoveries were confirmed by negative COVID-19 test results. Many infected Chinese people abroad as well as non-Chinese received by Dr. Yang and his team are recovering consecutively. None of them were seen to have serious post-COVID long-term syndrome. Nor did previous coronavirus patients in Wu Han, China, also received by Dr. Yang nearly three months ago, report any reinfection cases. But for the help of over 100 volunteers in Dr. Yang’s team, these would be unachievable.\nPerhaps the bereaved families who lost their loved ones suffer much more than death once the coronavirus has long-term impacts on these people, thought Dr. Yang. Since the Ministry of Health in different countries agreed that COVID vaccines are expected as soon as early next year, then what can we do since the vaccines are still half a year away?\nActually, the Eastern Han Dynasty had experienced over 300 pandemics. What did our ancestors do, and what will they do confronting the worldwide pandemics today? It is noteworthy that our ancestors had accumulated rich experiences to fight the pandemics and conquered numerous pandemics by self-quarantining, locking down and tossing limestone powder, etc.\nWith those cases in Wu Han, China again demonstrated to the world the value of TCM, containing within it five thousand years of Chinese wisdom and culture. Not only did it rescue people from hanging upside down, but it also promoted economic recovery in Wu Han and in China. Certainly, China has more cultural values - as priceless as antique collections - to show people all over the world just when they need it most and just when they suffer most.\nWith the development of science and technology, human beings are able to discover state-of-the-art vaccines. However, what are vaccines? Vaccines refer to bio-products derived from different pathogenic microorganisms to prevent and control all kinds of pandemics. They can be divided into live (attenuated) virus vaccines and killed (inactivated) vaccines. Common live virus vaccines include Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Measles, and plague vaccine, etc., while common killed vaccines include Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus, typhoid fever, Meningococcus, and Cholera Vaccine, etc. It usually takes one to two years to develop a new type of vaccine, by weakening or inactivating the pathogenic microorganism, or providing the genetic code for part of the pathogenic microorganism to prevent and control the pandemics.\nDuring the primary immune response to the first encounter with the unharmful pathogen, the immune system produces protective substances such as immunization hormones, active physiological substances, special antigens, etc., to protect the body. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. To put it more simply, vaccination is to use weakened, the unharmed virus that does not cause serious disease in people to enable the immunization to recognize and fight against the virus, so that the immune system will react to and fight infections automatically in the future. That’s why live, attenuated vaccines might cause fever and some other symptoms in weakened immunization systems. It is a war, an inflammatory storm between the immunization system and the virus.\nNow we understand that it is our own immunization systems that fight against those invading enemies. In other words, a vaccine cannot work without our immunity. Vaccinations are used to “train,” and “educate” the immune system in order to ultimately fight the infections. This teaches us that as long as our immunization cells are “well-learned,” our bodies produce antibodies to react to the viruses whenever they attack us again.\nHence, can we say that TCM may also function as a form of “vaccine”?\nThe way doctors of TCM think is a composition of Taiji Yin-Yang philosophy in Taoism and form-and-emptiness philosophy in Buddhism. For example, when one is asked “Where is the east,” the answer is, “There, the west is, where are the heart and spirit? There is seven Level of Quest for heart and spirit – no facet of life remains outside your spiritual growth and vision.”\nIn fact, the profundity of TCM lies in its preservation of one’s state of being/health, rather than the treatment of the disease, for it is already too late when the disease invades the body. People with strong immunity, as mentioned in the previous article on the Wechat media platform, recover soon with the help of TCM. However, the problem today is that people are ignorant of staying healthy and clutch at a straw the moment they are drowning - seriously ill. One of the coronavirus patients in the United States posted his medical bills – the amount is up to over 110 million dollars. He might be unable to pay off the debts even by using up his saving for a lifetime. Comparatively speaking, preservation of one’s being/health is much cheaper. The most important part of the preservation of one’s being/heart lies in the preservation of one’s heart and spirit, which is not only cheap but also effective.\nDr. Yang and his team referenced multiple ancient books of TCM. One day, at dawn, it suddenly occurred to Dr. Yang that the virus can be mitigated and killed by strengthening people’s immunity, and thus the TCM then used to strengthen people’s immunity will be called the TCM vaccine. Now our primary concern is to find the Chinese herbal prescription to strengthen people’s immune function. After rounds of discussions, analyses, and research, Dr. Yang and his team chose a classic prescription from ancient China. It is this TCM vaccine that saved accompanying family members in Wu Han, and medical workers in Wu Han, New York, Montréal, and Britain from being infected. Some Western medical workers start to get curious about the TCM vaccine; their trial of it saved them from infections. One medical worker, whose health condition is but of average level, was seen to have fully recovered within two weeks after taking the TCM prescription. Facts speak louder than words. A myriad of examples has proved the reliability of this TCM prescription.\nIn the middle of the following March 2020, we applied our approach and theory to the overseas market and provided TCM prescriptions to patients, their families, and medical workers. The surge in COVID-19 cases overseas witnessed many new symptoms that are different than those in Wu Han. The first time the COVID-19 overseas were found to get more severe and start to attack people’s central nervous systems, our team felt more anxious than ever, waiting for the feedback. Time flies. One month later, the clinical experience from the frontier and has brought positive feedback: among those medical workers who use our No 1. prescription, nobody was reported to have infected the virus. The test results showed that many people already had antibodies in their blood, proving the validity of the TCM vaccine.\nThis discovery overthrows the previous Western-dominated medical theories and illustrates with successful clinical experiences not only the new Chinese perspective but also the power of TCM. In addition, the secret about TCM lies in its dosage: people with different body constitutions and different symptoms should take different dosages at different times. The ultimate purpose, though, is to strengthen the immunity of the body.\nDr. Yang\n2020-06-22\n","description":"","id":13,"section":"posts","tags":["Preventive Herbs"],"title":"Preventive Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/posts/tcm-vaccine/"}]
