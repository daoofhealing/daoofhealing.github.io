Considering that most of these people are stranded abroad due to the changes in China’s entry policies, adjusted flights, and financial difficulties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, many enterprises and communities are actively participating in disaster relief.\nBy June 21, 2020, over 8.7 million coronavirus cases and 460 thousand deaths had been reported across the globe. With the help of volunteers, by June 13, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had provided free medical services for 720 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations provided reaching 1504, whereas, by June 21, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had helped 989 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in North America, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations hitting 2152. Dr. Yang’s dispensation of over 240 thousand concentrated powered of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had seen zero deaths among those patients. The youngest patient is only one month old, while the oldest is 82 years old – their recoveries were confirmed by negative COVID-19 test results. Many infected Chinese people abroad as well as non-Chinese received by Dr. Yang and his team are recovering consecutively. None of them were seen to have serious post-COVID long-term syndrome. Nor did previous coronavirus patients in Wu Han, China, also received by Dr. Yang nearly three months ago, report any reinfection cases. But for the help of over 100 volunteers in Dr. Yang’s team, these would be unachievable.\nPerhaps the bereaved families who lost their loved ones suffer much more than death once the coronavirus has long-term impacts on these people, thought Dr. Yang. Since the Ministry of Health in different countries agreed that COVID vaccines are expected as soon as early next year, then what can we do since the vaccines are still half a year away?\nActually, the Eastern Han Dynasty had experienced over 300 pandemics. What did our ancestors do, and what will they do confronting the worldwide pandemics today? It is noteworthy that our ancestors had accumulated rich experiences to fight the pandemics and conquered numerous pandemics by self-quarantining, locking down and tossing limestone powder, etc. With those cases in Wu Han, China again demonstrated to the world the value of TCM, containing within it five thousand years of Chinese wisdom and culture. Not only did it rescue people from hanging upside down, but it also promoted economic recovery in Wu Han and in China. Certainly, China has more cultural values - as priceless as antique collections - to show people all over the world just when they need it most and just when they suffer most. With the development of science and technology, human beings are able to discover state-of-the-art vaccines. However, what are vaccines? Vaccines refer to bio-products derived from different pathogenic microorganisms to prevent and control all kinds of pandemics. They can be divided into live (attenuated) virus vaccines and killed (inactivated) vaccines. Common live virus vaccines include Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Measles, and plague vaccine, etc., while common killed vaccines include Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus, typhoid fever, Meningococcus, and Cholera Vaccine, etc. It usually takes one to two years to develop a new type of vaccine, by weakening or inactivating the pathogenic microorganism, or providing the genetic code for part of the pathogenic microorganism to prevent and control the pandemics. During the primary immune response to the first encounter with the unharmful pathogen, the immune system produces protective substances such as immunization hormones, active physiological substances, special antigens, etc., to protect the body. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. To put it more simply, vaccination is to use weakened, the unharmed virus that does not cause serious disease in people to enable the immunization to recognize and fight against the virus, so that the immune system will react to and fight infections automatically in the future. That’s why live, attenuated vaccines might cause fever and some other symptoms in weakened immunization systems. It is a war, an inflammatory storm between the immunization system and the virus.\nNow we understand that it is our own immunization systems that fight against those invading enemies. In other words, a vaccine cannot work without our immunity. Vaccinations are used to “train,” and “educate” the immune system in order to ultimately fight the infections. This teaches us that as long as our immunization cells are “well-learned,” our bodies produce antibodies to react to the viruses whenever they attack us again.\nHence, can we say that TCM may also function as a form of “vaccine”?\nThe way doctors of TCM think is a composition of Taiji Yin-Yang philosophy in Taoism and form-and-emptiness philosophy in Buddhism. For example, when one is asked “Where is the east,” the answer is, “There, the west is, where are the heart and spirit? There is seven Level of Quest for heart and spirit – no facet of life remains outside your spiritual growth and vision.”\nIn fact, the profundity of TCM lies in its preservation of one’s state of being/health, rather than the treatment of the disease, for it is already too late when the disease invades the body. People with strong immunity, as mentioned in the previous article on the Wechat media platform, recover soon with the help of TCM. However, the problem today is that people are ignorant of staying healthy and clutch at a straw the moment they are drowning - seriously ill. One of the coronavirus patients in the United States posted his medical bills – the amount is up to over 110 million dollars. He might be unable to pay off the debts even by using up his saving for a lifetime. Comparatively speaking, preservation of one’s being/health is much cheaper. The most important part of the preservation of one’s being/heart lies in the preservation of one’s heart and spirit, which is not only cheap but also effective.\nDr. Yang and his team referenced multiple ancient books of TCM. One day, at dawn, it suddenly occurred to Dr. Yang that the virus can be mitigated and killed by strengthening people’s immunity, and thus the TCM then used to strengthen people’s immunity will be called the TCM vaccine. Now our primary concern is to find the Chinese herbal prescription to strengthen people’s immune function. After rounds of discussions, analyses, and research, Dr. Yang and his team chose a classic prescription from ancient China. It is this TCM vaccine that saved accompanying family members in Wu Han, and medical workers in Wu Han, New York, Montréal, and Britain from being infected. Some Western medical workers start to get curious about the TCM vaccine; their trial of it saved them from infections. One medical worker, whose health condition is but of average level, was seen to have fully recovered within two weeks after taking the TCM prescription. Facts speak louder than words. A myriad of examples has proved the reliability of this TCM prescription.\nIn the middle of the following March 2020, we applied our approach and theory to the overseas market and provided TCM prescriptions to patients, their families, and medical workers. The surge in COVID-19 cases overseas witnessed many new symptoms that are different than those in Wu Han. The first time the COVID-19 overseas were found to get more severe and start to attack people’s central nervous systems, our team felt more anxious than ever, waiting for the feedback. Time flies. One month later, the clinical experience from the frontier and has brought positive feedback: among those medical workers who use our No 1. prescription, nobody was reported to have infected the virus. The test results showed that many people already had antibodies in their blood, proving the validity of the TCM vaccine.\nThis discovery overthrows the previous Western-dominated medical theories and illustrates with successful clinical experiences not only the new Chinese perspective but also the power of TCM. In addition, the secret about TCM lies in its dosage: people with different body constitutions and different symptoms should take different dosages at different times. The ultimate purpose, though, is to strengthen the immunity of the body.\nDr. Yang\n2020-06-22\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"post","tags":[],"title":"Preventive Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements","uri":"https://daoofhealing.github.io/en/post/tcm-vaccine/"},{"content":"Together, Fighting COVID-19 Free Online Consultation and Free Herbal Supplement by Dr. Yang and Volunteer Team\nSummary\nAs of May 15, 2021, Global COVID-19 confirmed cases reach 162,059,913, with 3,360,727 deaths reported (Data from Johns Hopskins Covid-19 Map).\nIn the global efforts against the Covid-19, all nationalities, races, ethnicities, class backgrounds, governments, and many private organizations are doing their part in the fight.
