[{"content":"Posture and Key Points First of all, the principles of Zhan-Zhuang (standing meditation, sometimes called standing stumps practice) and meditation are actually the same. It\u0026rsquo;s just us labeling them as different things.\nIn terms of appearance, one is practiced in a standing form and the other is practiced in a sitting form. Nowadays, many of us spend more time sitting and less time standing, so today I will probably talk more about ‚Äúsitting‚Äù and less about ‚Äústanding‚Äù.\nWe all know somewhat the key points of the correct Zhan-Zhuang posture. One of them is that the acupoint on this side (at the right shoulder), and this point (at the left shoulder), should be aligned to our groin. And the two feet should be parallel, whereas the space in between them should not be too narrow, nor too wide. These six points should be in a straight line, as this is related to our body\u0026rsquo;s meridians.\nüëÜThe position pointed out in the picture is the acupoint on Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s right shoulder\nThis is the posture of Zhan-Zhuang. Then the main principle of Zhan-Zhuang is that the whole body must be relaxed. Let\u0026rsquo;s start from the top of the body. You can open your eyes, or slightly close your eyes. This is actually the same as sitting meditation. Then we put our lower jaw gently downward. We have two carotid arteries on both sides of the neck. The carotid artery has a lot of pressure within. You can see how high the blood can spray out when the general or soldier commit suicide by cutting their neck in movies and television dramas.\nIt is usually about one or two meters! This is tested in modern medicine. So, the blood pressure is very very high. In fact, these four vessels - our carotid arteries and the two (at the back of the neck) vertebral arteries - they contain very high pressure. Thus we need to put our jaw down and press it down a little to avoid the blood going upward too fast.\nIt is the same as sitting meditation. The waist cannot be too straight. If you stand with a very straight waist, the qi will rush upward and we will feel very hot. Therefore, the waist should be in a relaxed state, not too straight, and not to bend waist. It\u0026rsquo;s the same with Zhan-Zhuang and sitting meditation - the waist should be relaxed.\nAlso same as in sitting meditation, our abdomen should be tucked in a little bit. Do not sit too straight. If we tuck our belly in a little, we will find ourselves very relaxed. But if we are too straight, we will feel too hot. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to be in a relaxed state.\nBoth in sitting meditation and Zhan-Zhuang, our abdominal chakra is a very important place. Chinese medicine calls this area Shenque acupoint and Guanyuan acupoint; in Taoism it is called the lower Dantian.\nThis place should be in a relaxed state so that the energy is easy to gather. If you are too tense, too tight, too straight, the energy won\u0026rsquo;t easily gather in this area, and we will have no way to form the Neidan ( in Taoism energy is gathered in lower Dantian to form the Neidan). This is a key point.\nWhere to Put the Tongue Therefore, an essential point of practicing Zhan-Zhuang is to get our bodies in a state of complete relaxation. We have already talked about head position. Now we are going to talk about where we should put our tongues. We need to put the tongue on the palate. But here comes a tricky question: should you put your tongue at the front, middle or back part of your palate? I know lots of people putting their tongue at the front part of their palate. The positioning is actually incorrect. Pressing here (middle part of the palate) will be much better than here (front part of the palate), but it is best to press here (back part of the palate).\nPressing this place (middle part of the palate) helps towards opening the ‚Äúfan xue‚Äù, which is therefore not highly recommended. The reason is that nowadays many people are not in a calm state of mind and thus pressing our tongue at the middle part of the palate can possibly lead to disastrous symptoms mentally and/or physically.\nI recommend first using a posture coming from Taoism\u0026rsquo;s practice of ‚Äúbuilding the foundation in a hundred day‚Äù: Curl our tongue and press the tip of our tongue on the back of the palate. When we do that saliva will come out slowly and after we swallow it, it will return to our root chakra.\nWe swallow the saliva back in a slow pace because the saliva contains the essence of life. This is why old people produce less saliva. The younger and healthier a person is, the more saliva the person generates, as it is the essence of life.`\nSo gently press your tongue against here (back part of the palate). Do this naturally and in a relaxed way. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Thus far we have talked about head, eye, jaw, and tongue positions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t stretch your head too far frontward and do not let it stiffen up. Keep it naturally relaxed. The benefit is when you relax your head your shoulders will be relaxed accordingly. Many people do not relax their heads which leads to their whole bodies tightening up.\nKeeping Our Muscles Relaxed From my observation, a lot of people are very tense when they are practicing Zhan-Zhuang or meditation. That\u0026rsquo;s why you will often get a ‚Äúwarning stick ‚Äú strike (warning stick, also called as ‚Äúkeisaku‚Äù, is a tool used in Zen Buddhism for various purposes such as helping concentration during meditation). You see, you shouldn‚Äôt be too loose both mentally and physically, and you shouldn‚Äôt be too tight either. When someone strikes a warning stick on you, you feel all of a sudden relaxed and loose, right?\nBecause some people, in fact, most people, 99% of people are very nervous in daily life. So that‚Äôs why walking, living, sitting and sleeping are all practices towards enlightenment. He/she has to be in a very relaxed state in daily life, and after a very relaxed state, the circulations of qi and blood will be very smooth.\nWhen our muscles are tense, we know how anaerobic feels. ‚ÄúAnaerobic‚Äù means bad blood circulation, right? So when we are relaxed we are in an aerobic state. The qi and blood can circulate in this state. So through slow walking, jogging, we are in a very relaxed state and hence qi and blood are easy to circulate.\nWhen we are in an anaerobic state, we are very nervous. Most of us walk, live, sit and sleep in an anaerobic state throughout the day. When the body is in an anaerobic state, it will burst huge power for a short period of time, and this short period of explosive power encourages cell mutation. The cancer cells usually appear in an anaerobic state.\nWhy nowadays there are many people getting tumors and cancer? Mostly because they are in an anaerobic state and they are not relaxed physically and mentally. In fact, the feeling of resentment, hatred, annoyance, grievance, and upset are all part of his/her uneasiness. If his/her viscera are in a very relaxed state, he/she will not get any health issues. So the majority of liver cancer, stomach cancer, kidney cancer, and intestinal cancer cases are due to blockage, meaning that the blood is not circulating in that area.\nWhy nowadays there are many people getting tumors and cancer? Mostly because they are in an anaerobic state and they are not relaxed physically and mentally. In fact, the feeling of resentment, hatred, annoyance, grievance, and upset are all part of his/her uneasiness. If his/her viscera are in a very relaxed state, he/she will not get any health issues. So the majority of liver cancer, stomach cancer, kidney cancer, and intestinal cancer cases are due to blockage, meaning that the blood is not circulating in that area.\nTherefore that area is prone to generate certain bad body tissues. Especially the state of depression and stagnation of the cells will lead to a lot of cell‚Äôs death. The very few stronger cells, in order to survive, mutate and become cancer cells. That\u0026rsquo;s where the cancer cells come from.\nArouse the Immune System This is a relaxed state that we just mentioned. So why do we say that the upper body should be in a state of our chest slightly drawn in and our back straight? This (shoulder) place looks very nice when chest is kept very straight. However, because this place is too straight, this place is tense and not relaxed. So we need to relax this place.\nOur body has three immune systems. The first one is the neck lymph. We call it the neck lymphatic system. The second one is the underarm lymphatic system, and the third is the inguinal lymphatic system.\nüëÜThe position pointed out in the picture is the acupoints on shoulder to be relaxed\nThere are two important acupoints here in the shoulder area, both are slightly sunken in. As this place is very close to the first immune system of our human body, when we relax our shoulders, the neck lymph system and the underarm lymph system are relaxed as well. When we relax our shoulders continuously, these two immune systems will be aroused and they will become strong.\nWhen we are constantly in a state of tension, our immune system would be consequentially in a high-pressure state, and thus its functions become poor. So when we relax our body, it will be relatively strong.\nOur body has two nervous systems: one is the central nervous system and the other is the self-disciplined nervous system. The central nervous system controls our viscera from our brain, but some organs of our body have a self-disciplined nervous system themselves, and it is called the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in clinical medicine.\nThus, for example, our liver has a sympathetic nerve and a parasympathetic nerve. When we are nervous, our sympathetic nerve starts to function. It starts to work and mobilize resources.\nFor another example, when we are very nervous, the mechanism of the secretion of adrenal hormone, which belongs to a disciplined nerve of the kidney, begins to work. So it is a good thing for the adrenal hormone to start mobilizing, but after a long time, it gets tense and becomes tired.\nSo when we start to relax, our internal organs and parasympathetic nerves start to function, which can repair some damage in our body.\nSo, when we practice Zhan-Zhuang or meditation and go into a relaxed state, the parasympathetic nerves of our viscera begin to work. It begins to repair our body. This is why we need to relax when practicing Zhang Zhuang or meditation. Relaxation is playing a role in repairing the state of the body function.\nMost of us are in a state of tension and not relaxed enough, as most of us are very persistent and deeply attached to all sorts of things. Therefore we are relatively nervous no matter what we do, sometimes even unconsciously. So, our body is always in a state of tiredness and fatigue.\nIf we are not deeply attached to doing anything as well as its outcome, we will do what we need to do but rather in a very relaxed way. Our body would not have a state of fatigue and tiredness.\nWhat I said above is about a state of our body. Now let us talk about our back. Our back has many T cells, which are also our immune cells.\nWe said previously that our back posture should be straight with our chest slightly drawn in. But if we stretch our back very tight, it would be very tense. When we are very relaxed, the immune cells of our bodies also will be naturally in a relaxed state, thus facilitating their own recovery one by one.\nMoreover, drawing in our chest and keeping our back straight naturally at the same time smooths the qi in our lungs. And if we stretch our lung very tight, as the lung connects to all meridians in our bodies, the breath of the lung is not so smooth. So, when our back is straight naturally and our chest slightly drawn in, when we are relaxed like this, the qi in our lungs is easier to flow, and we will feel more comfortable.\nThe Key Points of the Lower Body Posture In the above, we talked about the upper body. As for the lower body, the most important key point is about the waist and the abdomen. As for the abdomen, the abdomen needs to be drawn in, and by doing this our waist will bend backward automatically, right? When our waist is very tight and straight, the hot qi moves upwards, and our abdomen will be very tense. This is not good for our energy to concentrate at our lower Dantian. So we want the abdomen to draw in, and we want our abdomen and waist to sink and not to stand too straight. This is a problem with the lower body posture.\nThen let‚Äôs talk about our feet. When practicing Zhan-Zhuang, our feet should not be standing straight. I have already mentioned the length between the feet - our feet should be aligned to our shoulder and our groin.\nThe inguinal lymphatic system in the groin area is the third lymphatic system of our human body. A lot of terminal cancer patients when doing B-ultrasound scanning, are found cancer cells spread to the neck lymphatic system.\nPatients in severe health conditions will get cancer cells spread to the underarm lymphatic system. When a patient gets CT scanning and found the inguinal lymphatic system is getting infected, then this patient is basically incurable. All the immune cells of this patient got infected and defeated. This is as if all of one‚Äôs royal guards are eliminated, then what does this person have to protect his/her viscera and body?\nSo I know that a patient is in the worst phase of terminal cancer if that person has the inguinal lymphatic system infected. It is very hard to cure at this stage.\nNot all diseases can be cured. When a person is terminally ill, when he/she is already dying, it is really difficult for him/her to be saved. Of course, there is a way, but we will talk about this later, and we will not mention this topic here.\nSo the width between the standing legs is the same as the width of our two shoulders, not too wide or too narrow. Also, the legs should be slightly curved when standing.\nThe goal of all these postures is to help us relax. As when our body and mind are not separated yet, the body is quite important.\nBut in the end of our practice, we can separate the body and mind naturally. Now that we haven‚Äôt reached this state, our consciousness cannot go out yet, and it hasn‚Äôt reached the state of immortality mentioned in Taoism. Our body and the mind, are combined together, and they are not completely separated.\nSo we must first maintain relaxation to the level that the qi and blood can circulate and flow smoothly. This point is actually very, very important. So one of the main points of our Zhan-Zhuang and meditation is to relax, relax and relax.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"meditation","tags":["Meditation","Standing Meditation"],"title":"Zhan-Zhuang and Meditation - The Detailed Tutorial","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/meditation/meditation-detailed-guide/"},{"content":"Subvert your ideas!

The one-year-old child had a lasting fever, diarrhea, and was wailing. The pediatrician said that if the virus caused it, there was no medicine to treat it; the child could only pull through it. Even non-parents would understand the mother\u0026rsquo;s anxiety and worries at this time.\nAlthough considered shrewd and capable in her family\u0026rsquo;s and friends' eyes, Alice still feels scared when she recalls this experience.\n02 It might be a virus Playing back the experience from April 7, our baby turned one year old, I took him to a pediatric clinic for a vaccine. The doctor told me that the child might have a fever in a few days. I didn\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. The baby had been vaccinated before, and after a short-term fever, he was fine within 24 hours. Unexpectedly, on the sixth day, the baby suddenly developed a fever of about 39¬∞C.He was given Tylenol every four hours, but his body temperature only dropped to about 37.5¬∞C, before a high fever rose again. The next day diarrhea started; tongue sores appeared; he was unwilling to drink milk or anything else. He was just lying on my shoulders and continuously \u0026ldquo;wailing\u0026rdquo; (I can only describe the child\u0026rsquo;s voice like this).\nI called the doctor. ‚ÄúIs this a response from the vaccine?‚Äù I asked. The doctor answered it was impossible. A baby may have a fever from the seventh to the tenth day after vaccination, but the fever will go away within 24 hours and not last five consecutive days. I became very nervous and asked the doctor what to do. The doctor supposed it was an acute baby rash. When the baby was three months old, he had a baby rash combined with a fever lasting five or six days. Now in the fifth day, no rash had appeared. The doctor said that I could come again, but I had to wait two days. During the pandemic, the practice was not open every day.\nMy husband and I took the child to see a doctor. The doctor said it might be a virus, and the virus may cause symptoms of tongue sores and diarrhea. We were very nervous. What virus was it? The doctor said he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the virus was; if the virus caused it, there was no cure for it, and the child could only fight it off by himself. We didn\u0026rsquo;t dare to think about COVID-19. Since mid-March, we had not been out except for the baby‚Äôs vaccination. We had been at home for almost a month. Was there a virus in the clinic? At that time, COVID-19 was not easily detectable, nor could every one test accurately in perceived suspected cases.\nI fell into a panic. The baby had a high fever for five days, and he could not take anti-fever medication every day.\n03 After all that, should I give the medicine to my baby? Then I thought of Dr. Yang. About a week or two before my baby got sick, I paid particular attention to his team and even planned to volunteer, but the baby was so fussy that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time. At this point, I thought perhaps Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine might relieve the symptoms caused by the unknown virus?\nOnce again, I contacted Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s volunteer team. With their warm-hearted help, I filled out a form for the first online consultation. Dr. Yang advised on the same day: treatment started immediately with 1g herbal mixture twice daily for three days. Following the consultation process, patients have to wait for their medication to be delivered, but the volunteers organized a pick-up. After my husband brought the medicine home, I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby. After all, the baby was only one year old, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if the cause was COVID-19.\n04 Enduring the distress AgainÔºå I contacted Xiangang, the leader of the volunteer team, to express my concerns. **What if this was the wrong medication and aggravated the illness? **Xianggang reassured me, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; Chinese medicine treats the symptoms and gets to the root of the problem. The herbal mixture is not aimed at a state of a disease but rather at improving immunity. No matter what the virus is, a strengthened immune system will fight it off naturally.\u0026rdquo;\nTaking himself as an example,he said he had had rhinitis for a long time. After taking Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medicine, the rhinitis symptoms reduced significantly. This medicine is not for rhinitis, but the improved immunity helped him. I thought Xiangang was right, and I felt assured enough to give this medicine to the baby once. The baby was too young to take the medication actively. It was even challenging to get him to drink some water. I had to give him the preparation by mouth with a syringe.\n05 The change The first time I gave the medicine, I noticed the baby began to sweat a lot. After that, the baby fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. Touching his forehead, the baby had no fever anymore. In the past, after taking an antipyretic, his temperature dropped to about 37.6¬∞Cand rebounded with a high fever later, but the temperature rarely fell below 37¬∞C. I‚Äôve read some information about Traditional Chinese Medicine, inducing sweat and relieving superficies stimulates inner circulation and reduces fever.\nThe day after the baby took the medicine, he had diarrhea again. I became afraid and contacted Xiangang immediately. He quickly put me in touch with Dr. Yang. I asked if the baby should continue to take medicine for the remaining two days. The doctor said with confidence that we must stick to it. I must dig my toes in to finish giving him the medication for three days. By the end of the third day, the child had no fever, the sores on his tongue resolved, the rashes on his legs cleared up, and most importantly, diarrhea was relieved. I think perhaps the child\u0026rsquo;s strengthened immunity had overcome the virus.\nIn the second consultation, Dr. Yang said that diarrhea is sometimes a good thing (I think it\u0026rsquo;s a detoxification process.) Doctor Yang says it\u0026rsquo;s best to take preventive medication for three more days to establish health. After taking the preventive medication, the child no longer had any symptoms. So far, I felt that I had made the right choice.\n06 Can you share this experience? Two days ago, Xiangang contacted me again and asked if I could share this experience. I said I strongly supported it. I hope that some other patients will benefit from our baby\u0026rsquo;s case. This medicine is more like a nutritional supplement that improves immunity. The baby is very energetic now, babbling like music every day, and sometimes his voice can overwhelm my voice. The gratitude in my heart is beyond words.\nI wish people in the world would be as pure and clear as babies and let the light of life drive away the pandemic\u0026rsquo;s haze.\nA mother‚Äôs contribution\n","description":"I was very hesitant to give the herbal mixture to our baby.

Not only does it affect the global economy and change everyone\u0026rsquo;s life and workstyle, but it also affects our physical and mental health. After nearly two years of a silent war against the epidemic and the promotion of vaccination, the epidemic seems to be at a turning point.\nEveryone seems to have been adapted to and accepted the new way of getting along with the epidemic, and no longer \u0026ldquo;fear the epidemic\u0026rdquo;; or we think that after we get vaccinated, we will have antibodies to protect us from the virus. However, who could have predicted that a special \u0026ldquo;product of the epidemic era\u0026rdquo; would quietly arise and lurk in our bodies?\nIt is the \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - the \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;. This type of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; is a side effect of the coronavirus vaccine, similar to allergies, eczema, rubella, measles, hives, chicken pox or shingles. For the time being, there seems to be no accurate answer, and it is up to the medical professionals to investigate.\nHere I would like to share my experience of fighting the rash. It‚Äôs just for your reference**. Some of my friends also experienced the rash after the vaccination, but the timing and symptoms of the rash varied from person to person. So was the treatment and recovery period.** It took me about 3 months after the vaccination to get this \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo;.\nA Friendly Reminder\nIf you have this kind of \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; symptom, please seek medical attention immediately. Follow the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions and cooperate with the treatment for early recovery. Remember there is an old saying: \u0026ldquo;A disease should be treated when symptoms are still very light, and let a disease untreated is like watching a tiger growing up.‚Äù\nSeek prompt medical attention for \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo; On September 27, 2021, which was a Monday afternoon, I felt a little bit itchy on my back and didn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to it. After midnight, I felt that my whole spine and shoulders were hot, and my back was covered with a thick red rash. The itch was unbearable and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep, but fortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fever.\nIn the morning of September 28, I immediately contacted Dr. Yang and received medical treatment from him. Within 4 days, I was almost fully recovered and the rash was all gone.\nPhysical, mental and dietary adjustments I think when dealing with any illness, the first and foremost thing to do is to calm your mind. As mental health directly affects physical health, it is important to keep a positive mindset when being sick. Secondly, it is important to adjust the body through diet and exercise, so that a strong and healthy body can resist the disease.\nAdjust your diet according to Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical advice  Eat light. Do not eat seafood, shrimp, crab, and eat less meat. (Remark: I am a vegetarian.) Do not eat cold and raw food: apples, bananas, pears, and oranges. Above food must be stewed and served hot. Eat some medically mild food: tomatoes, fungus, dark green vegetables/cauliflower; drink warm water/soup, and take ginger soup when needed. Do not eat spicy and greasy food. Drink as much warm water as possible after moxibustion.  Physical exercises generate Yang of one‚Äôs body During the treatment of \u0026ldquo;epidemic rash\u0026rdquo;, I was severely sleep-deprived, and I felt very tired and wanted to sleep during the day. However, I continued to do appropriate indoor exercises in the morning and in the evening. Such as BaDuanJin Qigong, shaking hands at least 200 times, vertical jumping 70-100 times, squatting and standing up at least 50 times, etc. I tried not to do outdoor activities and avoid the wind.\nEvery time after these exercises, my whole body felt warm and hot. This is the so-called \u0026ldquo;movement can produce Yang\u0026rdquo;. I think these exercises can improve our blood circulation and inject some natural heat energy into the body. With the proper heat, it boosts our metabolism and helps our body to recover.\nCommonalities and differences in rashes Commonality: Sleepless \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash is active during the second half of the night, and is particularly itchy and disruptive to sleep.\nDifferences: Wandering \u0026ldquo;rash\u0026rdquo; - The rash wanders and stays in various parts of the body with different symptoms.\n### My 4-day anti-rash record Day 1 Tuesday, September 1\nNeck rash ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on arms ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on the outside of legs‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nRash on the inner side of legs ‚¨ÜÔ∏è\nSymptoms: Red, itchy, and hot rashes appear around the neck, on the back, and on both sides of arms and legs.\nDon‚Äôt: wash with cold water or scratch with fingers.\nMoxibustion alternatively: Mingmen, Dazhui, and Taixi acupoints on the inner side of angles.\nHot pack: Relieve itchiness with hot packs.\nNight: Put a 45cmx30cm size red bean bag in the bed.

The cancer had spread all over the body and metastasized to the bones. After Dr. Yang treating her for more than a month, she went for a PET/CT again. We can see that 70% of the cancer cells that had metastasized to the bones disappeared, and even the doctor examining the PET/CT image was amazed and asking how this good result was achieved.\nPatient\u0026rsquo;s family provided: patient\u0026rsquo;s PET/CT image diagnosis report In April of this year, my mother suddenly felt pain in her shoulder and back, and my family thought it was frozen shoulder. So she took some physical therapy visits. But after a few days, the pain came back, and it worsened, affecting her body movement. After a CT scan, the doctor told me that my mother had pathological fractures and the doctor suspected my mother got lung cancer, and that bone metastases had occurred. On hearing this news we were extremely shocked.\nProvided by the patient‚Äôs family: patient hospital-transfer approval I immediately arranged my mom to be transferred to the best hospital in town - the Affiliated Hospital to Southwest Medical University, where she had further tests in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, such as CT, chest puncture, genetic testing, etc. The final diagnosis was advanced lung cancer and bone metastases had occurred. My family and I were devastated.\nMy mother had no symptoms at all previous to her diagnosis and she was very healthy. She could walk 10 kilometers nonstop. How could she suddenly suffer from a terminal disease, and diagnosed as at the advanced stage? I was so shocked at the day of the bad news that I was unable to sleep for five days in a row and lost 8 pounds. I am 40 years old and have never been unable to sleep. This news hit me extremely hard.\nAt this time, I told my best friend, Mr. Cai, who recommended Dr. Yang to us while comforting us. I met Dr. Yang in 2015 once and he helped me to improve my health. Dr. Yang immediately contacted me via WeChat, and after understanding my situation, asked me two questions, \u0026ldquo;Do you want to save your mom? Are you willing to trust me?\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to accept him and trust him. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing good deeds and accumulating good merit, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rescuing stray cats and dogs, rescuing left-behind children, and raising money for good cause, etc. I think this is due to my accumulated good merit.\nDr. Yang immediately told me about the regimen and precautions.\nStep 1: Let mom fast.\nStep 2: Dr. Yang taught me how to do moxibustion and told me to start doing it right away (I happened to have Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s homemade moxibustion strips which I bought earlier).\nAt first, I was confused about the fasting program, thinking, \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we give her more nutrition? How come she wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to eat? But I was determined to trust Dr. Yang. We followed the doctor\u0026rsquo;s instructions to the letter. Strangely enough, on the third day of fasting, which was also the third day after the moxibustion, my mom was not in pain anymore. The body pain turned into soreness and swelling, and we became more confident and more determined to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s treatment plan.\n(Translation of the image above: This is an advanced lung cancer patient accepted by Dr. Yang in April. As shown in the photo, the cancer has spread to the whole body, even to the bones. Many doctors had said that it was incurable. The patient came to Dr. Yang for help. Dr. Yang treated her for more than a month. When she did a body scan again we can see that 70% of the cancer cells metastasized to the bone had disappeared. Even the examination doctor asked what they did to achieve this. I asked Dr. Yang many times and he told me that one of the important points was to use Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. I know about Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s moxa sticks. He wanted to make moxa sticks himself in the early 2000s. However, for the past 18 years, the cause and conditions were not sufficient to make them. Dr. Yang traveled all over China and bought almost all the moxa sticks he could buy. In order to make good moxa, he went to the rural countryside, and stayed in the hand-made moxa production workshop, eating and sleeping on site*. The current situation of domestic moxa production is very complicated. The genuine* three-year-long moxa is very rare; in so many years I have only seen one genuine five-year moxa seller, and honestly speaking, I have no five-year moxa myself. Currently, almost all so-called ‚Äúwild moxa‚Äù are replaced by farm-produced moxa in the moxa market. In terms of the production process, the machine-made golden moxa replaced the original hand-made moxa. 100kg of Chinese mugwort can only produce 35kg of moxa if hand-made, whereas 90kg of moxa can be generated if made by machines. In order to look good, the machine-made moxa are all baked in high temperature to get the golden color. However, in this process, 30% of the moxa‚Äôs medicinal effect is lost and the moxa will produce a lot of smoke during moxibustion. As machine-made moxa come from Chinese mugwort which are not grown old enough, these moxa are quite humid. Moreover, one-year grown Chinese mugwort is even somewhat toxic. Dr. Yang always believes that only good medicine can cure illness so he never saves on the medicine cost. The moxa made this time are not planned to make commercial profits, so there is no saving on the production cost of the moxa. The moxa Dr. Yang made received good reviews from a small group of users and are exported to countries such as France, Canada, the U.S., and Spain. )\nDr. Yang taught us the location of the specific acupoints and the ordering of which acupoint to do moxibustion first. Every day my father and I took turns to do it for my mother. At first, in order to help dredge my mother‚Äôs meridians as soon as possible, every day we did moxibustion for every acupoint for more than half an hour. As for the important acupoints, we did moxibustion for more than an hour on each of them. Every day we did two rounds of moxibustion ( finishing all the acupoints in the right order was regarded as one round ), which took us basically 9 hours a day to complete.\nI got up after 5 am to make breakfast for my mother the way Dr. Yang told me. Then I did the standing stumps practice (Zhan Zhuang) and sitting meditation with her together. After that I went out for exercise and walking. After coming home and taking a short rest, I started the daily moxibustion treatment for my mother. I gave my mother fresh fruit and vegetable juice as supplements during the process. At noon, I gave my mother coarse grains and fresh vegetables for lunch, and I strictly avoided all meat in her diet. In the afternoon, I gave her a little bit of tremella lily soup. There was no dinner, and no food after 7 pm for my mother. In the first three days she was not adapted to it and felt hungry at night. Later she got used to it.\nLater, I received the herbal medicine prepared by Dr. Yang. My mother had nausea and vomited in the first two days of taking the medicine, but the symptoms stopped since the third day. After taking the medicine for a week, I sent a photo of my mother‚Äôs tongue to Dr. Yang for examination, and the appearance of her tongue indicated improvement. Dr. Yang told me: ‚ÄúKeep everything the same. Other than that, she could eat some fresh vegetables at night, just a little bit.‚Äù After another week, my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue appearance indicated huge improvement again. Then Dr. Yang asked us to change to another type of moxibustion. He changed the acupoints and adjusted the herbal medicine in our treatment plan.\nMy mother used to feel tired right away whenever she started any physical exercise after being diagnosed with cancer, like a cell phone which can only function for 5 minutes after charging 2 hours. Now she shows great improvement. We clearly feel that she has more energy - her voice is getting louder, and her spirit is getting better. Our whole family feels a little relieved. Day after day, on the 21st day, there was an incident. Dr. Yang suddenly noticed that the photo of my mother\u0026rsquo;s tongue showed regression in health conditions. He immediately talked to me on the phone to check the recent situation and then asked me to stop the targeted drugs, as my mother had been taking the targeted drugs prescribed by the hospital at the same time, which were quite harmful to the liver. The harm done was reflected in my mother‚Äôs tongue photo and Dr. Yang noticed this astutely in time. After discussing with my family, I decided to follow Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s advice and let my mother stop the targeted drugs, which was a bold decision based on my strong trust in Dr. Yang\u0026rsquo;s medical ethics and skills.\nA mother‚Äôs son\n2021.06\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"difficultcases","tags":["Cancer Treatment"],"title":"Real storyÔΩúMom's anti-cancer diary (Part one)","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/difficultcases/mom-cancer-diary-1/"},{"content":"‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà Today, after overcoming all kinds of obstacles, conquering all kinds of difficulties, and taking all kinds of risks, Dr. Yang and his team decided to post this Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements (TCM) prescription here in hopes of helping more people in prevention:\nFor healthy adults, take this prescription twice a day for 7 days; for adults of poor health, take this prescription twice a day for 10-14 days.\nAccording to statistics published by the Ministry of Commerce of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, by the end of March 2020, in addition to 1.43 million International students, there are at least 744 thousand Chinese citizens working and living overseas. Considering that most of these people are stranded abroad due to the changes in China‚Äôs entry policies, adjusted flights, and financial difficulties caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, many enterprises and communities are actively participating in disaster relief.\nBy June 21, 2020, over 8.7 million coronavirus cases and 460 thousand deaths had been reported across the globe. With the help of volunteers, by June 13, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had provided free medical services for 720 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations provided reaching 1504, whereas, by June 21, 2020, Dr. Yang and his team had helped 989 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 in North America, with the total number of counseling and medical consultations hitting 2152. Dr. Yang‚Äôs dispensation of over 240 thousand concentrated powered of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) had seen zero deaths among those patients. The youngest patient is only one month old, while the oldest is 82 years old ‚Äì their recoveries were confirmed by negative COVID-19 test results. Many infected Chinese people abroad as well as non-Chinese received by Dr. Yang and his team are recovering consecutively. None of them were seen to have serious post-COVID long-term syndrome. Nor did previous coronavirus patients in Wu Han, China, also received by Dr. Yang nearly three months ago, report any reinfection cases. But for the help of over 100 volunteers in Dr. Yang‚Äôs team, these would be unachievable.\nPerhaps the bereaved families who lost their loved ones suffer much more than death once the coronavirus has long-term impacts on these people, thought Dr. Yang. Since the Ministry of Health in different countries agreed that COVID vaccines are expected as soon as early next year, then what can we do since the vaccines are still half a year away?\nActually, the Eastern Han Dynasty had experienced over 300 pandemics. What did our ancestors do, and what will they do confronting the worldwide pandemics today? It is noteworthy that our ancestors had accumulated rich experiences to fight the pandemics and conquered numerous pandemics by self-quarantining, locking down and tossing limestone powder, etc.\nWith those cases in Wu Han, China again demonstrated to the world the value of TCM, containing within it five thousand years of Chinese wisdom and culture. Not only did it rescue people from hanging upside down, but it also promoted economic recovery in Wu Han and in China. Certainly, China has more cultural values - as priceless as antique collections - to show people all over the world just when they need it most and just when they suffer most.\nWith the development of science and technology, human beings are able to discover state-of-the-art vaccines. However, what are vaccines? Vaccines refer to bio-products derived from different pathogenic microorganisms to prevent and control all kinds of pandemics. They can be divided into live (attenuated) virus vaccines and killed (inactivated) vaccines. Common live virus vaccines include Tuberculosis, Poliomyelitis, Measles, and plague vaccine, etc., while common killed vaccines include Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus, typhoid fever, Meningococcus, and Cholera Vaccine, etc. It usually takes one to two years to develop a new type of vaccine, by weakening or inactivating the pathogenic microorganism, or providing the genetic code for part of the pathogenic microorganism to prevent and control the pandemics.\nDuring the primary immune response to the first encounter with the unharmful pathogen, the immune system produces protective substances such as immunization hormones, active physiological substances, special antigens, etc., to protect the body. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. To put it more simply, vaccination is to use weakened, the unharmed virus that does not cause serious disease in people to enable the immunization to recognize and fight against the virus, so that the immune system will react to and fight infections automatically in the future. That‚Äôs why live, attenuated vaccines might cause fever and some other symptoms in weakened immunization systems. It is a war, an inflammatory storm between the immunization system and the virus.\nNow we understand that it is our own immunization systems that fight against those invading enemies. In other words, a vaccine cannot work without our immunity. Vaccinations are used to ‚Äútrain,‚Äù and ‚Äúeducate‚Äù the immune system in order to ultimately fight the infections. This teaches us that as long as our immunization cells are ‚Äúwell-learned,‚Äù our bodies produce antibodies to react to the viruses whenever they attack us again.\nHence, can we say that TCM may also function as a form of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù?\nThe way doctors of TCM think is a composition of Taiji Yin-Yang philosophy in Taoism and form-and-emptiness philosophy in Buddhism. For example, when one is asked ‚ÄúWhere is the east,‚Äù the answer is, ‚ÄúThere, the west is, where are the heart and spirit? There is seven Level of Quest for heart and spirit ‚Äì no facet of life remains outside your spiritual growth and vision.‚Äù\nIn fact, the profundity of TCM lies in its preservation of one‚Äôs state of being/health, rather than the treatment of the disease, for it is already too late when the disease invades the body. People with strong immunity, as mentioned in the previous article on the Wechat media platform, recover soon with the help of TCM. However, the problem today is that people are ignorant of staying healthy and clutch at a straw the moment they are drowning - seriously ill. One of the coronavirus patients in the United States posted his medical bills ‚Äì the amount is up to over 110 million dollars. He might be unable to pay off the debts even by using up his saving for a lifetime. Comparatively speaking, preservation of one‚Äôs being/health is much cheaper. The most important part of the preservation of one‚Äôs being/heart lies in the preservation of one‚Äôs heart and spirit, which is not only cheap but also effective.\nDr. Yang and his team referenced multiple ancient books of TCM. One day, at dawn, it suddenly occurred to Dr. Yang that the virus can be mitigated and killed by strengthening people‚Äôs immunity, and thus the TCM then used to strengthen people‚Äôs immunity will be called the TCM vaccine. Now our primary concern is to find the Chinese herbal prescription to strengthen people‚Äôs immune function. After rounds of discussions, analyses, and research, Dr. Yang and his team chose a classic prescription from ancient China. It is this TCM vaccine that saved accompanying family members in Wu Han, and medical workers in Wu Han, New York, Montr√©al, and Britain from being infected. Some Western medical workers start to get curious about the TCM vaccine; their trial of it saved them from infections. One medical worker, whose health condition is but of average level, was seen to have fully recovered within two weeks after taking the TCM prescription. Facts speak louder than words. A myriad of examples has proved the reliability of this TCM prescription.\nIn the middle of the following March 2020, we applied our approach and theory to the overseas market and provided TCM prescriptions to patients, their families, and medical workers. The surge in COVID-19 cases overseas witnessed many new symptoms that are different than those in Wu Han. The first time the COVID-19 overseas were found to get more severe and start to attack people‚Äôs central nervous systems, our team felt more anxious than ever, waiting for the feedback. Time flies. One month later, the clinical experience from the frontier and has brought positive feedback: among those medical workers who use our No 1. prescription, nobody was reported to have infected the virus. The test results showed that many people already had antibodies in their blood, proving the validity of the TCM vaccine.\nThis discovery overthrows the previous Western-dominated medical theories and illustrates with successful clinical experiences not only the new Chinese perspective but also the power of TCM. In addition, the secret about TCM lies in its dosage: people with different body constitutions and different symptoms should take different dosages at different times. The ultimate purpose, though, is to strengthen the immunity of the body.\nDr. Yang\n2020-06-22\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"posts","tags":["Preventive Herbs"],"title":"Preventive Traditional Chinese Herbal Supplements","uri":"https://www.daoofhealing.org/en/posts/tcm-vaccine/"}]
